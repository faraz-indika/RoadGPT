INTRODUCTION 1.1 The first guidelines for the design of flexible pavements, published in 1970, were based on (i) subgrade (foundation) strength (California Bearing Ratio) and (ii) traffic, in terms of number of commercial vehicles (having a laden weight of 3 tonnes or more) per day. These guidelines were revised in 1984 considering the design traffic in terms of cumulative number of equivalent standard axle load of 80 kN and design charts were provided for design traffic volumes up to 30 million standard axle (msa) repetitions. The 1970 and 1984 versions of the guidelines were based on empirical (experience based) approach. 1.2 The second revision was carried out in 2001 [1] using semi-mechanistic (or mechanistic- empirical) approach based on the results available from R-6[2], R-56[3] and other research schemes of the Ministry of Road Transport and Highways (MoRTH). The mechanistic-empirical performance models for subgrade rutting and bottom-up cracking in the bottom bituminous layer, developed using the results of these research schemes, were used for the design of flexible pavements. FPAVE software, developed for R-56 research scheme for the analysis of linear elastic layered pavement systems, was used for the analysis of pavements and for the development of thickness design charts. Thickness charts were provided for design traffic levels up to 150 msa. 1.3 The third revision of the guidelines was carried out in 2012[4] to facilitate (i) design of bituminous pavements for traffic volumes more than 150 msa (ii) utilization of new types of pavement materials such as bituminous mixes with modified binders, foam/emulsion treated granular or Reclaimed Asphalt Pavement (RAP) material bases and sub-bases and cement treated sub-bases and bases and stabilized subgrades and (iii) utilization of new construction techniques/practices. Recommendations were made for the use of harder grade binders to resist rutting and top-down cracking in the upper bituminous layer and for fatigue resistant bituminous mixes for the bottom bituminous layer. Mechanistic-empirical performance models were given for rutting in subgrade and bottom-up cracking in bituminous layers for two different levels (80% and 90%) of reliability. Fatigue criteria were included for cement treated bases also. 1.4 The fourth (current) revision has been done based on the feedback received on the performance of bituminous pavements in general and that of bituminous layers in particular. Different provisions made in the third revision of the guidelines have been fine-tuned based on the feedback. Some of the salient features of the fourth revision are: (a) recommendation of better performing bituminous mixes and binders for surface and base/binder courses (b) guidelines for selection of appropriate elastic moduli for bituminous mixes used in the surface and other courses (c) recommendation of minimum thicknesses of granular and cement treated sub-bases and bases and bituminous layers from functional requirements (d) generalization of the procedure for the estimation of the effective resilient modulus/CBR of subgrade (e) provision for the use of geo-synthetics and (f) rationalization of the design approach for stage construction. 1.5 The draft of the basic document was prepared by Late Prof. B.B.

For the roads with a design traffic of less than 2 msa, IRC:SP:72[5] shall be adopted for pavement design. For rehabilitation of in-service pavements, overlay design shall be done as per Falling Weight Deflectometer (FWD) method (IRC:115)[6] or Benkelman Beam Deflection (BBD) test method (IRC:81)[7]. 2.2 Users of the guidelines are expected to use their skills, experience and engineering judgment and take into consideration the local climatic conditions, cost and availability of materials, their durability and past pavement performance in their respective regions for selecting a suitable pavement composition. 2.3 The guidelines may require revision from time to time in the light of future performance data and technological developments. Towards this end, it is suggested that all the organizations intending to use the guidelines should keep a detailed record of the year of construction, subgrade CBR, soil characteristics, pavement composition and specifications, traffic, pavement performance, overlay history, climatic conditions, etc., and provide feedback to the Indian Roads Congress for further revision. 3. DEsIGN PRINCIPLEs 3.1 While various sections of these guidelines describe the design procedures in detail, these are supplemented by a discussion on the ‘principle and approach to design’ given in the Appendix-A to this document, which needs to be considered as an integral part of the Guidelines. The Annexes (I to III) given to this document intend to elaborate the finer points of design and support the recommendations by different worked out design examples to help the users in familiarizing themselves with different provisions of the guidelines and for arriving at a safe, economical and performing design.

Performance of the pavement is explained by performance models which are either (a) purely empirical (only based on past experience) or (b) mechanistic-empirical, in which the distresses/performance are explained in terms of mechanistic parameters such as stresses, strains and deflections calculated using a specific theory and as per a specified procedure. Most of the current pavement design methods follow the mechanistic- empirical approach for the design of bituminous pavements. In these methods, for each of the selected structural distresses, a critical mechanistic parameter is identified and controlled to an acceptable (limiting) value in the design process. The limiting values of these critical mechanistic parameters are obtained from the performance models. 3.2 The mechanistic-empirical design approach, which was used in the second and third revisions of IRC:37, is retained in the current revision as well for the design of flexible pavements. The theory selected for the analysis of pavements is ‘linear elastic layered theory’ in which the pavement is modeled as a multi-layer system. The bottom most layer (foundation or subgrade) is considered to be semi-infinite, and all the upper layers are assumed to be infinite in the horizontal extent and finite in thickness. Elastic modulus, Poisson’s ratio and thickness of each layer are the pavement inputs required for calculation of stresses, strains and deflections produced by a load applied at the surface of the pavement. IITPAVE software, which is an updated version of FPAVE developed for MoRTH Research Scheme R-56 “Analytical design of Flexible Pavement”[3], has been used for the analysis of pavements. 3.3 The vertical compressive strain on top of the subgrade is considered in these guidelines to be the critical mechanistic parameter for controlling subgrade rutting. Horizontal tensile strain at the bottom of the bottom bituminous layer is taken as the causative mechanistic parameter which has to be limited to control bottom-up cracking in bituminous layers. Similarly, to ensure that the Cement Treated Bases (CTB) do not fail by fatigue cracking, tensile strain and tensile stress at the bottom of the CTB are considered to be the critical parameters to control. 3.4 Rutting within bituminous layers caused by accumulated plastic (permanent) deformation in these layers due to repeated application of traffic loads is another major distress which occurs in bituminous pavements. High pavement temperatures and heavy loads can cause early development of unacceptable levels of rut depth in bituminous mixes as the stiffness of the bituminous mix reduces at higher temperatures and the proportion of plastic (irrecoverable) deformation out of the total deformation will be larger under higher temperature and heavier loading conditions. Moisture damage of mixes and brittle cracking resulting from excessive age hardening of bitumen in the upper layers are the other major concerns to be taken into consideration. These distresses are considered by integrating the mix design into the structural design by incorporating the mix volumetric parameters into the performance models and by making suitable recommendations about the choice of binder and mix to be used in different layers. 3.5 For the satisfactory performance of bituminous pavements and to ensure that the magnitudes of distresses are within acceptable levels during the service life period, the guidelines recommend that the pavement sections be selected in such a way that they satisfy the limiting stresses and strains prescribed by the performance models adopted in the guidelines ####'),\n",

Additional measures have been suggested in the guidelines by way of integrating the mix design parameters that have a significant bearing on the performance of pavements into the design process. It may be noted that the design of the bituminous mix was integrated into the structural design process even in the second revision (2001 version) of IRC:37 as the strain values used in the fatigue and rutting performance models are computed using the elastic moduli of bituminous mixes and other layer materials. Also, the elastic modulus of the bituminous layer appears in the fatigue performance criterion. Suitable recommendations have also been made in the guidelines for (i) fatigue cracking and moisture damage resistant mixes for the bottom (base) bituminous layer (ii) rut and moisture damage resistant bituminous mixes for the intermediate (binder) bituminous layer (if provided) and (iii) rut, moisture damage, fatigue cracking and age resistant surface course and (iv) drainage layer for removal of excess moisture from the interior of the pavement. 3.6 Performance Criteria The following performance criteria are used in these guidelines for the design of bituminous pavements. 3.6.1 Subgrade rutting criteria An average rut depth of 20 mm or more, measured along the wheel paths, is considered in these guidelines as critical or failure rutting condition. The equivalent number of standard axle load (80 kN) repetitions that can be served by the pavement, before the critical average rut depth of 20 mm or more occurs, is given by equations 3.1 and 3.2 respectively for 80 % and 90 % reliability levels. The rutting performance model developed initially based on the MoRTH R-6 Research Scheme[2] performance data was subsequently developed into two separate models for two different reliability levels based on the additional performance data collected for MoRTH R-56 Research Scheme[3].

For the computation of stresses, strains and deflections in the pavement, thicknesses and elastic properties (elastic modulus and Poisson’s ratio) of different layers are the main inputs. Detailed instructions for installation and use of IITPAVE software, which is provided along with these guidelines, are given in Annex I. Guidelines for the selection of the elastic modulus and Poisson’s ratio values of different pavement layers are given in different sections of the guidelines. For the calculation ####'),\n",

Only one set of dual wheels, each wheel carrying 20 kN load with the centre to centre spacing of 310 mm between the two wheels, applied at the pavement surface shall be considered for the analysis. The shape of the contact area of the tyre is assumed in the analysis to be circular. The uniform vertical contact stress shall be considered as 0.56 MPa. However, when fatigue damage analysis of Cement Treated Bases (CTB) is carried out, (using Equations 3.5 to 3.7) the contact pressure used for analysis shall be 0.80 MPa. The layer interface condition was assumed to be fully bound. The materials are assumed to be isotropic. 3.6.2 Fatigue cracking criteria for bituminous layer The occurrence of fatigue cracking (appearing as inter connected cracks), whose total area in the section of the road under consideration is 20 % or more than the paved surface area of the section, is considered to be the critical or failure condition. The equivalent number of standard axle (80 kN) load repetitions that can be served by the pavement, before the critical condition of the cracked surface area of 20 % or more occurs, is given by equations 3.3 and 3.4 respectively for 80 % and 90 % reliability levels. The fatigue performance models given by equations 3.3 and 3.4 were developed under MoRTH R-56 scheme[3] utilizing primarily the R-6 scheme (Benkelman Beam Studies) performance data[2] supplemented by the data available from R-19 (Pavement Performance Studies)[8] and R-56 schemes[3].

       " Document(metadata={'source': 'IRC:37-2018', 'page': 7}, page_content='A popular approach used for enhancing the fatigue life of bituminous layers is to make the bottom most bituminous mixes richer in bitumen[10]. Larger binder volume in the mix means an increased thickness of the binder film in the mix and an increase in the proportion of bitumen over any cross-section of the layer normal to the direction of tensile strain. Besides having longer fatigue lives, larger binder volumes will also be beneficial in making the mix more moisture damage resistant due to thicker binder films which also reduce the ageing of the binder. Considering that the bottom bituminous layer will be subjected to significantly lower stresses and lower summer temperatures compared to the upper layers, the chance of rutting of the lower layer will be less. The recent version of the Asphalt Institute manual for mix design[10] recommends design of the bitumen rich mixes (or rich bottom mixes) at 2 to 2.5 per cent air voids and to compact the rich bottom layer to less than 4 per cent in-place air voids. The recommendations made in these guidelines about the volumetric parameters and the in-place air voids to be achieved are given in para 9.2. 3.6.3 Fatigue performance models for Cement Treated Base (CTB) 3.6.3.1 In the case of pavements with CTB layer, fatigue performance check for the CTB layer should be carried out as per equation 3.5 (based on cumulative standard axle load repetitions estimated using vehicle damage factors), and as per equations 3.6 and 3.7 (cumulative fatigue damage analysis) using axle load spectrum data. It may be noted that ‘cement treated’ refers to stabilization by different types of cementitious materials such as cement, lime, fly- ash, or a combination thereof. The terms, ‘cement treated’ and ‘cementitious’, have been used interchangeably in these guidelines. Equation 3.5 is based on the Australian experience[11] whereas equation 3.6 is as per the recommendations of the Mechanistic-Empirical Pavement Design Guide[12].

Similarly, one application of a tridem axle may be considered as three single axles, each weighing one third the weight of the tridem axle. For example, if a tridem axle carries a load of 45 tonnes, it may be taken to be equivalent to three passes of a 15 tonne single axle.

       " Document(metadata={'source': 'IRC:37-2018', 'page': 13}, page_content='4. TRAFFIC 4.1 General This section covers the guidelines for the estimation of design traffic for new roads. The guidelines consider that the structural damage to the pavement i.e., fatigue cracking in the bound layers and rutting in the subgrade is caused by the applied traffic loads. The relative structural damage caused to the pavement by different types of axles carrying different axle loads is considered using Vehicle Damage Factors (VDFs) in the estimation of design traffic. 4.1.1 The design traffic is estimated in these guidelines in terms of equivalent number of cumulative standard axles (80 kN single axle with dual wheels). For estimating the factors required to convert the commercial traffic volumes into equivalent repetitions of the standard axle, it is necessary to measure the axle load spectrum relevant for the stretch of road under consideration. Axle load spectrum data are especially required for the design of pavements having layers treated/stabilised using cementitious materials such as cement, lime, fly ash, etc., for estimating the cumulative fatigue damage expected to be caused to the cement treated base by different axle load groups. The following inputs are required for estimating the design traffic (in terms of cumulative standard axle load repetitions) for the selected road for a given design period. (i) initial traffic (two-way) on the road after construction in terms of the number of commercial vehicles (having the laden weight of 3 tonnes or more) per day (cvpd) (ii) average traffic growth rate(s) during the design life period (iii) design life in number of years (iv) spectrum of axle loads (v) factors for estimation of the lateral distribution of commercial traffic over the carriageway 4.1.2 Only the commercial vehicles having gross vehicle weight of 3 tonnes or more are considered for the structural design of pavements. 4.1.3 Estimation of the present day average traffic should be based on the seven-day 24-hour traffic volume count made in accordance with IRC:9[15]. 4.2 Traffic Growth Rate 4.2.1 For estimating the cumulative traffic expected to use the pavement over the design period, it is necessary to estimate the rate(s) at which the commercial traffic will grow over the design period. The growth rates may be estimated as per IRC:108[16]. Typical data required for estimation of the growth rates(r) are: (i) past trends of traffic growth and (ii) demand elasticity of traffic with respect to macro-economic parameters (like the gross domestic product and state domestic product) and the demand expected due to specific developments and land use changes likely to take place during the design life period. ####'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'IRC:37-2018', 'page': 14}, page_content='4.2.2 Traffic growth rates shall be established for each category of commercial vehicles. In the absence of data for estimation of the annual growth rate of commercial vehicles or when the estimated growth rate is less than 5 per cent, a minimum annual growth rate of 5 per cent should be used for commercial vehicles for estimating the design traffic. 4.3 Design Period 4.3.1 The design period to be adopted for pavement design is the time span considered appropriate for the road pavement to function without major rehabilitation. It is recommended that a design period of 20 years may be adopted for the structural design of pavements for National Highways, State Highways and Urban Roads. For other categories of roads, a design period of 15 years is recommended. Pavements for very high density corridors (more than 300 msa) and expressways shall preferably be designed as long-life pavements. Otherwise, for such corridors, the pavement shall be designed for a minimum period of 30 years. The commercial traffic, converted into equivalent repetitions of the standard axle, and adjusted for directional distribution, lateral distribution over the carriageway width, etc., is the design traffic. 4.3.2 Design traffic considerations for stage construction Stage construction of pavement may be adopted in projects where the growth of traffic is uncertain or future traffic volumes are expected to increase substantially due to future developments. Stage construction may also be adopted in projects for which subsequent maintenance is mandated on ‘performance basis’. For projects in which stage construction is adopted, the base and sub- base layers shall be designed for the full design period. Stage construction is not allowed for pavements with cement treated bases and sub-bases. Stage-1 bituminous layer(s) of the pavement should be designed for more traffic than estimated for the initial (first) stage design period (or traffic) so that the pavement will have at least 40 % life remaining after stage-1 period (traffic). Assuming that the pavement life consumed increases linearly with traffic, the design traffic for stage-1 shall be taken as 1.67 times the design traffic estimated for stage-1 period. If designed and constructed for only the stage-1 design traffic, the pavement, especially the bituminous layer, may not have adequate the structural condition and is lightly to develop full depth cracking and thus may not be suitable for periodical maintenance measures such as patching, crack sealing and micro-surfacing. The requirement of the second stage pavement shall be determined after evaluation of the structural condition of the pavement by Falling Weight Deflectometer (FWD) method as per IRC:115[6] or by Benkelman Beam Deflection (BBD) method as per IRC:81[7]. An example of the design carried out following the concept of stage construction is given in Annex-II. 4.4 Vehicle Damage Factor 4.4.1 The guidelines use Vehicle Damage Factor (VDF) for the estimation of cumulative repetitions of standard axle load for the thickness design of pavements. In the case of pavements with CTB layer, in addition to the fatigue performance check carried out as per equation 3.5 based on cumulative standard axle load repetitions (estimated using VDF), CFD analysis also should be carried out following the approach given by equations 3.6 and 3.7 using axle load spectrum data. ####'),\n",

PAVEMENT COMPOsITIONs A flexible pavement considered in these guidelines essentially consists of three functional layers above the subgrade. These are: sub-base, base and bituminous layers. Detailed discussion on subgrade and each of the pavement layers is presented in the subsequent sections of the ####'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'IRC:37-2018', 'page': 18}, page_content='guidelines. The sub-base and base layers may be (a) granular, (b) cement treated or (c) a combination of granular and cement treated materials. Base layer can also be a foam bitumen or emulsion treated granular/Reclaimed Asphalt Pavement (RAP) material/combination of RAP and aggregate layer. When CTB is used, a crack relief layer is to be mandatorily provided, either as an aggregate interlayer or as a stress absorbing membrane inter-layer (SAMI). The bituminous layer comprises two different types of materials, categorized as bituminous base and surfacing. If the base bituminous layer is constructed in two layers, these are generally termed as binder and base bituminous layers. Unless specified otherwise, each functional layer can be constructed in one or more layers. The same elastic properties (elastic/resilient modulus and Poisson’s ratio) may be considered for all the sub-layers of a functional layer for the analysis of the pavement using linear elastic layered theory (IITPAVE software). Granular sub-base layers (filter and drainage layers) and granular base layer are considered (unless specified otherwise) as a single layer in the analysis of the pavement. Similarly, bituminous base (binder and base) and surfacing course are considered as a single layer. Aggregate (granular) crack relief layer shall be considered as a separate layer in the analysis. The SAMI crack relief treatment (if used) over the CTB layer shall not be considered in the structural analysis. 6. sUBGRADE 6.1 General On new roads, the aim should be to construct the pavement as far above the water table as economically practicable. The difference between the bottom of subgrade level and the level of water table/high flood level should, generally, not be less than 1.0 m or 0.6 m in case of existing roads which have no history of being overtopped. In water logged areas, where the subgrade is within the zone of capillary saturation, consideration should be given to the installation of suitable capillary cut-off as per IRC:34 at appropriate level underneath the pavement. The top 500 mm of the prepared foundation layer immediately below the pavement, designated as subgrade, can be made up of in-situ material, select soil, or stabilized soil forming the foundation for the pavement. It should be well compacted to derive optimal strength and to limit the rutting caused due to additional densification of the layer during the service life. It shall be compacted to attain a minimum of 97 per cent of the laboratory maximum dry density obtained corresponding to heavy compaction as per IS:2720 Part-8[17] for Expressways, National Highways, State Highways, Major District Roads and other heavily trafficked roads. When the subgrade is formed using a material which is stronger than the upper 500 mm of embankment soil or when the subgrade itself is prepared in two separate layers with significantly different strengths, the effective combined contribution of the subgrade and the embankment layers has to be considered for design. The principle to be used for the estimation of the effective strength or mechanical property is discussed in para 6.4. As previously mentioned in these guidelines, the elastic/resilient moduli of different pavement layers are the main inputs for the analysis and design of pavements. Since the measurement of resilient modulus of soil requires sophisticated equipment, the same is generally estimated from the California Bearing Ratio (CBR) value of the material. The following sections present the details of the compaction effort and moisture content to be used for preparing the specimens in the laboratory for evaluating the CBR value or resilient modulus value of the soil. ####'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'IRC:37-2018', 'page': 19}, page_content='6.2 selection of Dry Density and Moisture Content for Laboratory Testing of subgrade Material 6.2.1 The laboratory test conditions should represent the field conditions as closely as possible. Compaction in the field is done at a minimum of 97 per cent of the laboratory maximum density obtained at optimum moisture content. In the field, the subgrade undergoes moisture variation depending on different local conditions such as water table depth, precipitation, soil permeability, drainage conditions and the extent to which the pavement is impermeable to moisture. In high rainfall areas, lateral infiltration through the unpaved shoulder, median, porous and cracked surface may have a significant effect on the subgrade moisture condition. The California Bearing Ratio (CBR) of the subgrade soil, for the design of new pavements and reconstruction, should be determined as per IS:2720 Part-16[18] at the most critical moisture condition likely to occur at the site. The test should be performed on remoulded samples of soils in the laboratory. The pavement thickness should be based on 4-day soaked CBR value of the soil, remoulded at placement density (minimum 97 % of maximum Proctor compaction test density) and optimum moisture content ascertained from the compaction curve. In areas with less than 1000 mm rainfall, four-day soaking may be too severe a condition for a subgrade well protected with thick bituminous layer and the strength of the subgrade soil may be underestimated. If data is available about the seasonal variation of moisture, the moulding moisture content for the CBR test can be selected based on the field data. The test specimens should be prepared by static compaction to obtain the target density. 6.2.2 Frequency of tests and design value If the type of soil used in different stretches of the subgrade varies along the length of the pavement, the CBR value of each type of soil should be the average of at least three specimens prepared using that soil. 90th percentile subgrade CBR value should be adopted for the design of high volume roads such as Expressways, National Highways, State Highways and Urban Roads. For other categories of roads, the design can be done based on the 80th percentile CBR value if the design traffic is less than 20 msa and based on 90th percentile CBR if the design traffic is 20 msa or more. 6.3 Resilient Modulus of the subgrade Resilient modulus, which is measured taking into account only the elastic (or resilient) component of the deformation (or strain) of the specimen in a repeated load test is considered to be the appropriate input for linear elastic theory selected in these guidelines for the analysis of flexible pavements. The resilient modulus of soils can be determined in the laboratory by conducting the repeated tri-axial test as per the procedure detailed in AASHTO T307-99[19]. Since these equipment are usually expensive, the following relationships may be used to estimate the resilient modulus of subgrade soil (MRS) from its CBR value[20, 21]. M = 10.0 * CBR for CBR ≤ 5 % (6.1) RS M = 17.6 * (CBR)0.64 for CBR > 5 % (6.2) RS Where, M = Resilient modulus of subgrade soil (in MPa).

Alternatively, the 500 mm thick subgrade may be laid in two layers, each layer material having different CBR value. In such cases, the design should be based on the effective modulus/CBR value of a single layer subgrade which is equivalent to the combination of the subgrade layer(s) and embankment layer. The effective modulus/CBR value may be determined as per the following procedure which is a generalization of the approach presented earlier in an Indian Roads Congress publication[22]. (i) Using IITPAVE software, determine the maximum surface deflection (δ) due to a single wheel load of 40,000 N and a contact pressure of 0.56 MPa for a two or three layer elastic system comprising of a single (or two sub-layers) of the 500 mm thick subgrade layer over the semi-infinite embankment layer. The elastic moduli of subgrade and embankment soils/ layers may be estimated from equations 6.1 and 6.2 using their laboratory CBR values. Poisson’s ratio (μ) value may be taken as 0.35 for all the layers. (ii) Using the maximum surface deflection (δ) computed in step (i) above, estimate the resilient modulus M of the equivalent single layer using RS equation 6.3. M = (6.3) RS ( ) Where, p = contact pressure = 0.56 MPa a = radius of circular contact area, which can be calculated using the load applied (40,000 N) and the contact pressure ‘p’ (0.56 MPa) = 150.8 mm μ = Poisson’s ratio It is the effective resilient modulus (M ) value and not the CBR that is used in the design. RS However, if required, the CBR value can be reported using equations 6.2 and 6.3. A worked out example for the estimation of the effective resilient modulus/CBR is given in Annex-II. In case the borrow material is placed over a rocky foundation, the effective CBR may be larger than the CBR of the borrow material. However, only the CBR of the borrow material shall be adopted for the pavement design. Additionally, proper safeguards should be taken against the development of pore water pressure between the rocky foundation and the borrow material. If the embankment consists of multiple layers of materials having different CBR values, multi- layer analysis can be carried out using IITPAVE software and the effective resilient modulus can be estimated using the concept discussed above. 6.4.2 For the purpose of design, the resilient modulus (M ), thus estimated, shall be limited RS to a maximum value of 100 MPa. 6.4.3 The effective subgrade CBR should be more than 5 % for roads estimated to carry more than 450 Commercial Vehicles Per Day (CVPD) (two-way) in the year of construction. ####'),\n",

The sub-base layers can be made of granular material which can be unbound or chemically stabilized with additives such as cement, lime, flyash and other cementitious stabilizers. The thickness of the sub-base, whether bound or unbound, should meet these functional requirements. To meet these requirements, minimum sub-base thicknesses have been specified in the following paragraphs. 7.2 Granular (Unbound) sub-Base Layer 7.2.1 Sub-base materials may consist of natural sand, moorum, gravel, laterite, kankar, brick metal, crushed stone, crushed slag, reclaimed crushed concrete/reclaimed asphalt pavement, river bed material or combinations thereof meeting the prescribed grading and physical requirements. When the granular sub-base material consists of a combination of different materials, mixing should be done mechanically by either using a suitable mixer or adopting the mix-in-place method. Granular sub-base (GSB) should conform to the MoRTH Specifications for Road and Bridge Works[23]. If the thickness of the sub-base layer provided in the design permits, the sub-base layer shall have two sub layers; drainage layer and the filter layer. The upper layer of the sub-base functions as a drainage layer to drain away the water that enters through surface cracks. The lower layer of the sub-base should function as the filter/separation layer to prevent intrusion of subgrade soil into the pavement. The aggregate gradations recommended for the drainage layer are granular sub- base gradations III and IV of MoRTH Specifications[23]. The gradations I, II, V and VI specified for GSB by MoRTH[23] are recommended for filter/separation layer. If the design thickness of the granular sub-base is less than or equal to 200 mm, both drainage and filter layers cannot be provided separately (considering the minimum thickness requirements given in 7.2.2). For such cases, a single drainage-cum-filter layer with GSB gradation V or VI of MoRTH Specifications may be provided. The filter and drainage layers should be designed as per IRC:SP:42[24] and IRC:SP:50[25]. It is necessary to extend both drainage and filter layers to full width up to the slope of the embankment to have efficient drainage. Commercially available synthetic geo-composite, grid lock geo-cell with perforated vertical faces filled with aggregates meeting the requirement as specified in IRC:SP:59[26] can also be used to function as both filter/separation and drainage layers. Its strengthening effect can be considered in the pavement design in accordance with the provisions of IRC:SP:59. When GSB layer is also provided below the median in continuation with that of the pavement, a non-woven geo-synthetic may be provided over the GSB in the median part so that the fines percolating through the median do not enter into the GSB and choke it. 7.2.2 Minimum thicknesses of granular sub-base layers Irrespective of the design traffic volume, the following minimum thicknesses of granular sub- ####'),\n",

(iii) The minimum thickness of any compacted granular layer should preferably be at least 2.5 times the nominal maximum size of aggregates subject to a minimum of 100 mm. (iv) The total thickness of the granular sub-base layer should be adequate to carry the construction traffic that may ply on the GSB. This thickness requirement may be worked out to satisfy the subgrade rutting limiting strain criterion given by equation 3.1 or 3.2 (as applicable for the classification of highway and design traffic). The design traffic for this purpose can be worked out based on the expected number of operations of dumpers and other construction vehicles on the GSB layer to carry material for the construction of granular or cement treated base layer. The indicative values of construction traffic loading and the procedure given in the worked out example in Annex-II can be used for the estimation of the construction traffic operating over the granular sub-base if more accurate and practical estimation cannot be done. (v) The sub-base thickness should be checked for the design traffic worked out as per the above mentioned procedure or 10,000 standard axle repetitions, whichever is more. (vi) The two-layer system (subgrade and GSB) should be analyzed by placing a standard load over it (dual wheel set of 20,000 N each acting at 0.56 MPa contact pressure) and computing (using IITPAVE) the maximum subgrade vertical compressive strain. The GSB thickness should be varied until the computed strain is less than or equal to the limiting subgrade vertical compressive strain, given by equations 3.1 or 3.2 (as applicable). The worked out example given in Annex-II illustrates the estimation of GSB thickness from construction traffic consideration. 7.2.3 Resilient modulus of GSB layer The elastic/resilient modulus value of the granular layer is dependent on the resilient modulus value of the foundation or supporting layer on which it rests and the thickness of the granular layer. A weaker support does not permit higher modulus of the upper granular layer because of the larger deflections caused by loads result in de-compaction in the lower part of the granular layer. Equation 7.1[20] may be used for the estimation of the modulus of the granular layer from its thickness and the modulus value of the supporting layer.

While the conventional cement stabilized material should attain this strength in seven days, granular materials and soil-aggregate mixture stabilized with lime, pozzolanic stabilizers, lime-fly ash etc., should meet the above strength requirement in 28 days since the strength gain in such materials is a slow process. As considered in the case of sub-bases, average laboratory strength values should be 1.5 times the required minimum (design) field strength. The cementitious base material must also meet the durability criteria given in Para 8.2.4. For the functional requirement, the thickness of cement treated bases shall not be less than 100 mm. The procedure to be followed for the estimation of the thickness of the CTB layer required to cater to the construction traffic has been illustrated in Annex-II. The elastic modulus of cementitious bases depends upon the quality of materials. Low grade aggregates such as moorum and kankar may give lower modulus at lower cement contents. Fine grained soil may require larger quantity of cementitious additive for higher strength and may develop wider cracks upon curing. Equation 7.2 may be used for estimating the elastic modulus of E from the 28-day Unconfined Compressive Strength (UCS) of CTB material. CTB Poisson’s ratio value of CTB material may be taken as 0.25.

The values of modulus of rupture (MPa) for cementitious bases may be taken as 20 per cent of the 28-day UCS value (MPa)[12] subject to the following limiting (maximum) values: Cementitious stabilized aggregates - 1.40 MPa Lime-flyash-soil - 1.05 MPa Soil-cement - 0.70 MPa A relationship between UCS, Indirect Tensile Strength (ITS) and Flexural Strength, if developed for the materials being used in a project, will be useful for quality control since ITS is easy to determine on the cores taken from the field. Flexural Strength is approximately 1.5 times the ITS value for cement bound aggregates. 8.2.3 While the minimum size of the sample of the beam for cement stabilized aggregate for flexure test should be 100 mm x 100 mm x 500 mm, the beam size for flexural tests for stabilized soil with hydraulic binders (cement, lime, lime-flyash and other commercially available cementitious binders) can be 50 mm x 50 mm x 250 mm to 75 mm x75 mm x 375 mm. Third point loading shall be applied at a rate of 1.25 mm per minute, which is the same as that used in the CBR test. 8.2.4 Durability criteria The minimum quantity of cementitious material in the bound base layer should be such that in a wetting and drying test (BIS: 4332 Part-IV[29], the loss of weight of the stabilized material does not exceed 14 per cent after 12 cycles of wetting and drying. In cold and snow bound regions like Arunachal Pradesh, Jammu & Kashmir, Ladakh, Himachal Pradesh etc., durability should also be evaluated by freezing and thawing test and the loss of weight should be less than 14 per cent after 12 cycles as per BIS:4332 Part-IV. 8.3 Crack Relief Layer In case of pavements with CTB, a crack relief layer, provided between the bituminous layer and the cementitious base, delays the reflection of crack from the CTB layer in to the bituminous layer. The crack relief layer may consist of dense graded crushed aggregates of 100 mm thickness conforming to MoRTH[23] Specifications for Wet Mix Macadam (WMM) or the Stress Absorbing Membrane Interlayer (SAMI) of elastomeric modified binder applied at the rate of 10 – 12 kg/10 m2 covered with 0.1 m3 of 11.2 mm aggregates.

For high traffic volume roads with a design traffic of more than 50 msa, (a) Stone Matrix Asphalt (SMA)[34], (b) Gap Graded Mix with Rubberized Bitumen (GGRB) [35] and (c) Bituminous Concrete (BC) with modified binders, are recommended for surfacing course for durable, ageing resistant and crack resistant surface courses. For the Stone Matrix Asphalt (SMA) mix (recommended for high traffic volume roads) also, use of modified binders is preferred as it is expected that mixes with modified binders will result in longer service life and will be more resistant to ageing. For roads (national highways as well as non-national highways) with design traffic in the range of 20 to 50 msa, and for national highways with less than 20 msa design traffic, BC with VG40 bitumen can be used for the surface course in addition to the aforementioned mixes. For highly stressed areas or roads in high rainfall areas and junction locations, mastic asphalt mix can be used as an alternative surface course.

These guidelines recommend VG30/VG40 bitumen for design traffic less than 20 msa and VG40 bitumen for the DBM layers for design traffic of 20 msa or more. For expressways and national highways, even if the design traffic is less than 20 msa, VG40 or modified bitumen shall be used for surface course and VG40 bitumen shall be used for the DBM. In view of the overlap in the viscosity ranges specified in IS:73[36] for VG30 and VG40 bitumen, it is recommended that the VG40 bitumen used in the surface, binder and base bituminous courses shall have a minimum viscosity of 3600 Poise at 60°C temperature to safeguard against rutting. For snow bound locations, softer binders such as VG10 may be used to limit thermal transverse cracking (especially if the maximum pavement temperature is less than 30°C). If the total thickness of the bituminous layers is less than 40 mm, VG30 bitumen may be used for the BC/SDBC layers even if VG40 bitumen may be more appropriate from pavement temperature consideration. Thin pavements will deflect more under the traffic loads and stiffer VG40 mixes may not have adequate flexibility to undergo such large deflections.

The modulus values given in Table 9.2 are based on a number of laboratory tests conducted on bituminous mix specimens as per ASTM:4123[37] upgraded now to ASTM: D7369-09[38]. ASTM: D7369-09 essentially retains most of the features of ASTM 4123 but recommends that Poisson’s ratio also be measured. ASTM:4123 permits the use of assumed Poisson’s ratio values. These guidelines recommend measurement of the resilient modulus at a temperature of 35°C as per ASTM:4123[37] with an assumed Poisson’s ratio value of 0.35. A loading pulse of 0.1 second duration followed by a rest period of 0.9 second is adopted. Bituminous mixes undergo reduction in air void content, harden with time and the modulus value will increase due to ageing effect and the actual modulus values could be more than those given in Table 9.2. For the measurement of the resilient modulus of DBM, 150 mm diameter specimens should be used because of the larger size of aggregates used in the DBM mixes. The modulus value of bituminous mixes prepared with modified bitumen varies widely depending upon the modifier, duration of blending, quantity of admixtures and the extent of air blowing of the base bitumen. These mixes may have lower resilient modulus value than those of the mixes prepared with unmodified bitumen. The lower resilient modulus values of mixes with modified binders are due to the larger proportion of elastic/resilient deformation/strain possible with modified mixes. The smaller resilient modulus values do not necessarily indicate that modified binder mixes will have inferior performance compared to unmodified mixes. In fact, mixes with modified binders are, in general, expected to have better fatigue and rutting performance and durability compared to conventional mixes. As mentioned previously in these guidelines, all the bituminous layers in the pavement shall be considered as one layer in the analysis of the pavement and will be assigned the same elastic properties (elastic/resilient modulus and Poisson’s ratio). Considering the possibility that the resilient moduli of Stone Matrix Asphalt[34], GGRB[35] and BC mixes with modified binders will be less than those obtained for dense graded mixes (BC and DBM) prepared with unmodified binders such as VG40, and taking into consideration that these surface mixes are expected to give much better performance than the conventional dense graded mixes with unmodified binders, these guidelines recommend that the bituminous layer (combination of all the bituminous layers) shall be assigned the modulus value of the DBM mix (bottom DBM mix if two DBM layers are used) for analysis and design. ####'),\n",

The DBM layer may be constructed in a single layer or in two layers depending upon the design thickness requirement. When only one layer of DBM is used, DBM-1/DBM-2 (selected depending on the thickness of the layer) may be constructed with a suitable surface course. When the DBM is laid in two layers, the sequence of bituminous layers from the bottom to top is: DBM-1, DBM-2 and a suitable surface course. For longer life of bituminous pavements, to avoid moisture induced distresses and for better bottom-up fatigue resistance, bitumen rich DBM bottom layer is recommended in these guidelines. The rich bottom mixes are typically designed to have more binder volume by selecting lower design air void content which yields more design binder content than normal. It is also a common practice to compact the rich bottom bituminous mixes to smaller in-place air voids. The increased compaction adopted for these mixes will result in mixes with good aggregate interlocking and will make the mixes stiffer. The increased compaction will also reduce the mix rutting that might be produced in the mix by secondary compaction under traffic load stresses. In view of the increased binder requirement, the upper limit of the voids filled with the bitumen (VFB) criterion for such bottom rich mixes designed as per the following criteria, shall be 80%.

Hence V and V must be correctly estimated as per Asphalt a be Institute Mix Design, MS-2[10]. The minimum thicknesses of different bituminous layers shall be as per relevant MoRTH and IRC specifications.

LONG-LIFE PAVEMENTs A pavement having a life of fifty years or longer is generally termed as a long-life pavement or perpetual pavement. In the Indian context, pavements with a design traffic of 300 msa or more may be designed as long-life pavements. As per Asphalt Institute, MS-4, 7th edition[39], if the tensile strain caused by the traffic in the bituminous layer is less than 70 microstrain (considered to be the endurance limit of the material), the bituminous layer will never crack. Similarly, if the vertical subgrade strain is less than 200 microstrain, there will be practically very little rutting in the subgrade. For the climatic conditions prevailing in the plains of India, where the Average Annual Pavement Temperature may be close to 35°C, the corresponding limiting strains may be taken as 80 and 200 microstrains respectively. Thus, long-life pavement design involves selecting a suitable pavement layer combination which can keep the horizontal tensile strain and vertical compressive strain limited to the afore-mentioned limiting strain values corresponding to endurance condition. Different layers of the long life pavement have to be designed and constructed in such a way that only the surface course would need replacement from time to time. A design example is given in Annex-II. 11. PAVEMENT DEsIGN PROCEDURE 11.1 steps involved in the Pavement Design 11.1.1 Selecting a trial composition In selecting the pavement composition, the designer should be guided by the expected functional requirements of the layers in a high performing pavement, such as a strong subgrade, a well- drained sub-base strong enough to withstand the construction traffic loads, a strong crack, rutting and moisture damage resistant bituminous base and a bituminous surfacing that is resistant to rutting, top-down cracking and to damages caused by exposure to environment. 11.1.2 Bituminous mix design and the mix resilient modulus Sourcing of the material ingredients for the mix has to be decided and the physical requirements and properties of the sourced materials should be checked for their conformity with the provisions ####'),\n",

The right proportioning of the mix ingredients or the design mix should be arrived at by trials and testing. Where the resilient modulus is required to be tested in accordance with the procedures recommended in these Guidelines, the samples of the design mix should be appropriately tested as specified. Where the resilient modulus is required to be derived indirectly by using empirical equations given in these Guidelines or are to be adopted as per a certain recommended value, the modulus should be selected/determined accordingly and used for design subject to the compliance with the conditions specified in these Guidelines. In case the resilient modulus determined in this manner exceeds the limiting values specified in these Guidelines, the latter value has to be adopted. In case, it is less than the limiting value, the actual value should be adopted in the design. 11.1.3 Selecting layer thickness The selection of trial thicknesses of various layers constituting the pavement should be based on the designers’ experience and subject to the minimum thicknesses recommended in these Guidelines and in other relevant Specifications (when there is no specific recommendation in these guidelines) from functional and constructability considerations. 11.1.4 Structural analysis of the selected pavement structure This is to be done by running the IITPAVE software or any other linear elastic layer programme using as inputs the layer thicknesses, the layer moduli, the layer Poisson’s ratio values, the standard axle load of 80 kN distributed on four wheels (20 kN on each wheel), and a tyre pressure as 0.56 MPa. For carrying out fatigue damage analysis of cement treated bases, the axle load under consideration and a contact pressure of 0.80 MPa will be considered. The program will output the stresses, strains and deflections at selected critical locations in the pavement from which the values of critical mechanistic parameters can be identified for design. A soft copy of the IITPAVE software is attached as part of this document. Details about IITPAVE and instructions for its installation and use are given in Annex-I. Table 11.1 gives the details of different inputs to be considered for the analysis. 11.1.5 Computing the allowable strains/stresses The allowable strains in the bituminous layer and subgrade for the selected design traffic are to be estimated using the fatigue and rutting performance (limiting strain) models given in these guidelines. The inputs to the models are the design period of pavement in terms of cumulative standard axles, the resilient modulus value of the bottom layer bituminous mix, and the volumetric proportions (air voids and effective binder) of the mix. For estimating the limiting tensile strain in the CTB layer, the elastic modulus of the CTB material is an input. 11.1.6 Doing the iterations A few iterations may be required by changing the layer thicknesses until the strains computed by IITPAVE are less than the allowable strains derived from performance models. 11.1.7 Check for cumulative fatigue damage Where cementitious bases are used in the pavement, the cumulative fatigue damage analysis is required to be done as done in the case of rigid pavement design to make sure that the cumulative damage caused by the expected axle load spectrum does not exceed unity. ####'),\n",

A large number of pavement design options are possible for less than 50 msa design traffic with varying values of (a) design traffic (b) effective subgrade CBR (c) reliability (d) mix volumetric parameters and the corresponding ‘C’ factor (e) pavement composition (f) classification of highway and (g) binder used with the base (DBM/BM) mix. It must be noted that the catalogues are for the specific inputs considered for developing them. The designers or the user agencies are advised to get familiarized with the use of IITPAVE software (for which very detailed guidelines are given in Annex-I) so that pavements can be designed with any selected combination of inputs. ####'),\n",

At the subgrade level, fine grained clayey and silty soils are more susceptible to ice formation, but freezing conditions could also develop within the pavement structure if water has a chance of ingress from above. 13.2 One remedy against frost attack is to increase the depth of construction to correspond to the depth of frost penetration, but this may not always be economically practicable. As a general rule, it would not be advisable to provide total pavement thickness less than 450 mm even when the CBR value of the subgrade warrants a smaller thickness. In addition, the materials used for building up the crust should be frost resistant. 13.3 Another precaution against frost attack is that water should not be allowed to collect at the subgrade level which may happen on account of infiltration through the pavement surface or verges or due to capillary rise from a high water table. Whereas capillary rise can be prevented by subsoil drainage measures and cut-offs, infiltrating surface water can be checked only by providing a suitable surfacing course and a subsurface drainage system. 14 QUALITY CONTROL TEsTs DURING CONsTRUCTION The recommendations contained in Clause 903 of Specifications of the Ministry of Road Transport and Highways for Road and Bridge Works[23], IRC:120[33], IRC:SP:89[28], IRC:SP:59[26] about different tests along with their frequencies for different types of specifications to ensure quality in the construction are to be followed.

       " Document(metadata={'source': 'IRC:37-2018', 'page': 56}, page_content='APPENDIX-A THE PRINCIPLEs AND APPROACH FOLLOWED IN THEsE GUIDELINEs A.1 An Overview Highway pavements should be safe and serviceable. They should be capable of carrying the loads coming on it during their life period without unacceptable levels of failures. Unlike structures where the failure is usually followed by complete collapse, failure in pavements is not sudden but usually by gradual deterioration over time. At some stage in its life, when the deterioration renders it unserviceable to the users, the pavement is assumed as failed. Thus, safety criteria in pavement design are defined by serviceability thresholds (such as acceptable cracking and rutting), which, if breached, the design should be considered as unsafe and pavement unserviceable. A.2 Cracking in Bituminous Layers Cracking in pavement can occur in three primary modes: (a) bottom up cracking, (b) top down cracking, and (c) low temperature cracking. A.2.1 Bottom up cracking A.2.1.1 Cracks may initiate at the bottom of any bound layer due to fatigue phenomenon reducing the effective layer thickness causing the cracks to progress and move upwards with repeated application of traffic loads. When the whole layer cracks, the crack progresses into the upper layer and will eventually appear on the surface of the pavement as alligator cracks. Mixes should have adequate flexural tensile strength and should be sufficiently flexible at intermediate temperatures at which the traffic loads (except the very small proportion of traffic which is applied when the pavement has peak summer or peak winter temperatures) to resist fatigue cracking caused by repeated flexure under traffic loads. Stiffer mixes usually have larger flexural tensile strength compared to the softer ones. However, the higher stiffness is usually associated with more brittleness. The fatigue cracking in bituminous layers has been addressed in these guidelines using a performance model which gives limiting tensile strain value for a given design traffic level and for a selected mix. A.2.1.2 The fatigue cracking susceptibility of the bituminous layer can be reduced by controlling the flexural tensile strains at the bottom of the bituminous layer. This can be done by (i) providing a strong support from the underlying layers which reduces the deflection in the bituminous layer (ii) using stiffer bituminous mix which reduces the tensile strain in the material and (iii) using a mix that is adequately elastic to recover from damage. A.2.1.3 A strong subgrade is essential for giving firm support to the upper pavement layers. The elastic modulus of the subgrade (required as input for analysis using linear elastic layered theory) is recommended to be estimated from its CBR value using the empirical equations given in the guidelines. When there is significant difference in the mechanical properties of the material used in the prepared subgrade compared to the material used in the embankment, it ####'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'IRC:37-2018', 'page': 57}, page_content='is proposed to estimate an equivalent subgrade property (effective modulus) for use in design. These guidelines recommend the use of subgrades with a minimum effective CBR of 5% for roads with more than 450 commercial vehicles per day. These Guidelines also restricts the value of the effective modulus of the subgrade that can be used for design to a maximum value of 100 MPa. A.2.1.4 Since determining the resilient (elastic) modulus of the granular material used in the sub-base and base layers requires sophisticated equipment and skill, it is proposed to estimate the modulus value of the granular layer from a widely used empirical equation for which the elastic modulus value of the supporting layer and the thickness of the granular layer are inputs. A.2.1.5 In situations where granular materials are placed over cementitious materials, e.g. granular base over cementitious sub-base and granular crack relief layer over cemented bases, the layer M cannot be estimated directly using the same empirical equation as mentioned r above. Though models are available in literature for estimating the modulus of granular layer based on the state of stress prevailing in the material, no such rigorous analysis is proposed in these guidelines for estimating the resilient modulus of the granular materials. A resilient modulus value of 450 MPa is proposed for the crack relief layer of WMM placed over CTB. In case of a granular base placed over cementitious sub-base (CTSB), the recommended values are 300 MPa and 350 MPa for natural gravel and crushed rock respectively. A.2.1.6 The modulus values of cemented materials are usually estimated from their Unconfined Compressive Strength (UCS) values (if the flexural modulus cannot be determined directly). The values estimated from the laboratory measured UCS are not adopted directly for analysis and design for two reasons, (i) these are laboratory values of the UCS tested on ‘un-cracked’ material samples while in the field, the material, if used in the sub-base, will start cracking immediately on application of the construction traffic and progressively loses its strength during construction as well as ‘in-service’ stages till it reaches the fully cracked terminal condition when it will behave more like a granular material rather than a rigid layer, (ii) higher the UCS wider will be the cracks, which have the chance of reflection into the overlying layer leading to an undesirable situation for pavement performance. Therefore, lower UCS materials are targeted to use in pavement layers. A.2.1.7 The design elastic modulus of cemented sub-base materials is capped at a relatively low value of 600 MPa because of the possibility of the layer getting cracked right from the start. As far as the cementitious bases are concerned, the design modulus is recommended as 5000 MPa. These recommended values of modulus values are subject to the condition that the laboratory values of the UCS are within the ranges specified in these guidelines. A.2.1.8 Testing the durability of the cementitious base materials is compulsory. This is because the low UCS materials have small quantity of cement binder and there may be the likelihood of inadequate binding of the materials, especially if the proportion of fines in the materials is high. The loss of weight in the ‘wetting- drying’ or ‘freeze-thaw’ test as relevant will reveal whether the cemented material will be durable when subjected to moisture cycles and other adverse climatic conditions. ####'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'IRC:37-2018', 'page': 58}, page_content='A.2.1.9 The cementitious bases have to be analysed for cumulative fatigue damage as recommended in these Guidelines. Fatigue performance models have been recommended in these guidelines for cemented bases. Flexural strength (modulus of rupture) of the CTB material is necessary for carrying out the cumulative fatigue damage analysis. The guidelines recommend that the flexural strength of the cement treated materials may be taken as 20 per cent of the UCS value. A.2.1.10 Where Reclaimed Asphalt Pavement (RAP) material (with or without addition of virgin aggregate), stabilised with foamed bitumen or emulsion is used as base, a conservative value of 800 MPa is recommended as the modulus value of the material for design provided the RAP mixes are designed and tested as per the procedure recommended in these Guidelines. A.2.1.11 The resilient moduli of bituminous mixes used in the surface and base/binder layers are important inputs affecting the distribution of stresses and strains in different layers of the pavement, rutting and top-down cracking resistance of the upper layers and bottom-up cracking of the lower bituminous layer. The resilient modulus of bituminous mix varies over a wide range depending upon the aggregate gradation selected and the grade of bitumen used besides other influencing conditions. The temperature for which the M value should be considered for design r is 35°C and the recommended test procedure is as in ASTM D4123. A.2.2 Top down cracking A.2.2.1 At the instance when the tyres come in contact with the road surface, they expand laterally and push the pavement surface at their edges. At the next instance when the tyre moves over, the laterally pushed surface should be elastic enough to pull itself back. If it is not, the surface will crack at the wheel edges along the longitudinal direction and the crack will propagate downwards from the surface. Another reason for top down cracking is the age hardening of bitumen. With age and exposure to sun light and Ultra Violet rays, the volatiles in bitumen are lost and the binder becomes hard and brittle, which significantly increases the cracking susceptibility of the material. A.2.2.2 The objective of design for controlling top down cracking should be to use mixes that can accommodate more bitumen to have thicker films which reduce the rate of ageing, to minimize the effect of ageing by using ageing resistant modified binders in the surfacing course, to improve the visco-elastic properties of the binder by using binders that have better elastic recovery. These Guidelines recommend Stone Matrix Asphalt (SMA) and Gap Graded Rubberised Bitumen (GGRB) and Bituminous Concrete (BC) with modified binders, for high traffic (more than 50 msa) roads. In other cases, stiff grade binders or modified binders are considered suitable for surface course mixes. A.3 Rutting in Bituminous Pavements A.3.1 Rutting in pavement occurs in two ways: (a) Due to deformation in subgrade and other unbound layers (granular sub-base and base and (b) due to rutting in bituminous layer. The guidelines provide limiting strain criteria for controlling rutting in subgrade. Even through no separate criteria are included in the guidelines for rutting in the granular layers, controlling the vertical compressive strain on top of subgrade indirectly results in the control of strains in ####'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'IRC:37-2018', 'page': 59}, page_content='the upper granular layers. Larger elastic strains in the subgrade and unbound granular layers (which are calculated by linear elastic layered theory) are generally expected to produce larger plastic strains. Thicker bituminous layers and stronger sub-bases/bases (such as CTSB and CTB) reduce the subgrade strains significantly. A.3.2 Even if the subgrade or unbound granular layers do not undergo rutting, the bituminous layers may do. This happens in various situations such as when the bituminous layers are not initially properly compacted and undergo large secondary compaction during their service life, the binder used is of a softer grade, has less elasticity, high pavement temperatures and high wheel load stresses. It is necessary to use sufficiently stiffer mixes with binders that will have less plastic deformation at high temperatures and high stresses, especially in the upper layers. At lower depths, the stresses as well as the temperatures will be less compared to the surface layers and thus the lower bituminous layers are less susceptible to rutting. A.4 structural Analysis of Pavement A.4.1 These Guidelines continue to follow the Mechanistic-Empirical approach for pavement analysis as in its previous two versions. The stresses and strains in the pavement layers are analysed by the software IITPAVE, which requires inputs from users in terms of number of layers, their thicknesses and elastic moduli. Standard loading of 80 kN acting over four wheels (two dual wheel sets on each side of the axle) at 0.56 MPa uniform contact pressure is considered for the analysis. For evaluating the CTB bases, a contact pressure of 0.80 MPa shall be considered. A.4.2 The trial pavement composition and layer thicknesses are selected and the stresses and strains at the critical locations are computed by running the IITPAVE software. The permissible strains are obtained from the fatigue and rutting models, for a given design traffic (csa). If the computed strains are larger than those derived from the model (limiting strains), the trial composition and layer thicknesses are changed until the values come within the permissible limits. A.5 Effect of Climate and Environment on Pavement Performance A.5.1 The discussion so far has been on the response of the pavement to load repetitions and on the design of pavement to limit the cracking and rutting. Climate and environment are other factors, which can affect the performance of pavements. A.5.2 Water entering the cracks from bottom (bottom up cracks), top (top down cracks) or sides (shoulders or medians) may strip the bitumen leading to loss of bond between aggregates and bitumen, and may reduce the strength of granular and subgrade layers. A.5.3 Binders age when exposed to environment and lose volatiles, harden, become brittle and then crack. Thus, it is necessary to use an appropriate grade of bitumen, with modifications if required, in the surfacing layer to make it resistant to the oxidation of bitumen. A.5.4 At high temperatures, the binder and hence the mix becomes softer and is susceptible to rutting. At low temperatures, the mix is likely to become brittle and is susceptible to cracking. Hence, binders that are less temperature susceptible and have adequate properties at high as well low service temperatures are expected to yield better performance. ####'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'IRC:37-2018', 'page': 60}, page_content='A.5.5 The resilient modulus of bituminous layers is quite sensitive to temperature. At high temperatures, the modulus is low and at low temperatures it is high. The maximum pavement temperature is important for understanding which grade of binder would be the most suitable for designing bituminous mixes. One model, based on research carried elsewhere, has the potential to predict the average seven day maximum surface temperature of the pavement from the corresponding air temperatures. T = [(T - 0.00618Lat2 + 0.2289Lat + 42.2) * (0.9545)] – 17.78 (A-1) 20 mm air Where, T = Pavement temperature (°C) at a depth of 20 mm 20mm Lat = Latitude of the place T = Average of maximum temperatures (°C) of seven days air Based on this equation and for the maximum temperatures prevailing in different parts of the country, it is reasonable to consider that in most parts of the country, the maximum pavement temperature may reach around 70°C. A.5.6 The appropriate grade of binder for a given project site should ideally be the one that is suitable for the range of variation in the pavement temperature. Even though there appears to be some gap in the existing standards with regard to the suitability of binders in extreme temperature conditions that are likely to prevail in the country, it is recommended that the grade suitable for temperatures nearest to the specified maximum could be adopted. Very broadly, the stiffest grade of available bitumen should be used where the pavement temperature is expected to rise above 60°C and the softer grades under low temperature conditions. A.6 Mix Design A.6.1 Bituminous binder/base courses and the surfacing courses have different requirements. The base is subjected to flexural tension and, therefore, needs to have sufficiently large stiffness (modulus) to reduce strains. Larger stiffness is usually achieved with dense aggregate grading as in DBM. Fatigue cracking starts at the bottom of the base. The mix also has to be sufficiently flexible to be more compliant with the deflections to which the layer will be subjected to under traffic loads. The fatigue life of the layer/mix can be increased by increasing the per cent of bitumen in the mix, but the dense grading of DBM does not allow enough void space to accommodate more bitumen without reducing the air voids. More bitumen and less air voids in the DBM would increase the fatigue life. Top down cracking starts at the surfacing at the edges of the wheel because the inflation pressure of the tyres at the contact surface deforms it across the wheel path and the mix should be elastic enough to recover this deformation after the passage of the wheels. The binder in the surfacing layer should, therefore, have high elastic recovery. Surfacing is also exposed to atmosphere and thereby to ageing. Therefore, the surfacing material should be age resistant. The surfacing is also exposed to water damage by stripping or displacement of the bitumen film by water, and therefore, it should be resistant to water damage. A.6.2 Some considerations for design of bituminous mix for base layer A high resilient modulus of DBM (typical base/binder course mix) should be targeted in the design, which in comparison to mixes having low or moderate resilient modulus values, will ####'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'IRC:37-2018', 'page': 61}, page_content='result in smaller tensile strain and less plastic strain under the same set of loading and hence will result in smaller DBM layer thicknesses. Thus, a higher resilient modulus mix will be more appropriate to resist both cracking (unless the mix becomes too brittle) and rutting. A high resilient modulus mix can be achieved by a strong granular skeleton of aggregates represented by their grading. DBM grading-I having higher maximum nominal size of aggregates will have a stronger aggregate structure compared to DBM Grading-II of MoRTH. The choice between the two aggregate gradings, however, is also dependent upon the layer thickness, which should not be less than 2.5 times the maximum nominal size of the aggregate. The lower layer DBM mix has to be rich in bitumen and low in air voids. The lower layer DBM, subject to the thickness and nominal size limitations, should be in Grading-I. The larger size fractions of aggregates and lower surface area would enable more void space to accommodate additional quantity of bitumen and thicker coating of aggregate particles by bitumen. The likelihood of rutting of the layer is minimal for two reasons, first because the lower layer is subject to lower stresses as the intensity of the load decreases with depth, and secondly the maximum temperatures of the bottom bituminous layer will be significantly smaller compared to the maximum temperatures applicable for the surface layer. Also, the degree of secondary compaction in the bottom layer will be less due to the fact that the bottom layer will have more confining stresses than the upper layers. A part of the quantity of bitumen used in the mix is lost in the aggregate pores where the aggregates have porosity even though it is within permissible limits. This will reduce the effective quantity of bitumen in the mix, which might make the mix deficient in bitumen. It is necessary that the binder quantity lost due to absorption by aggregates should be carefully estimated during the mix design process. Ingress of water into the DBM layer from shoulder and median needs to be prevented by taking adequate measures so that stripping and loss of bond between aggregates and Bitumen does not happen. A.6.3 Some considerations for design of bituminous mixes for surfacing layer Surfacing layer should have good elastic recovery property, which means that the binder should have less plastic deformation at higher temperatures. The surfacing layer should have adequate binder to make it durable. Selecting surface mixes in which more binder can be used has three main advantages; first, it will provide better bonding of aggregate and binder; second, on exposure to atmosphere it will resist the effects of oxidation and ageing, (with the resulting reduction in the top-down cracking susceptibility) and third, resistance to moisture damage. For accommodating more binder, the aggregates should have more void space to accommodate the additional binder. This is somewhat difficult if the grading is a dense one as used in BC. The grading has to be opened up while retaining the granular load bearing skeleton that gives strength. Stone Matrix Asphalt (SMA) and Gap-Graded Rubberised Bitumen (GGRB) are examples of such mixes. These Guidelines strongly recommend SMA and GGRB as surfacing layers and BC with modified binders on all important roads having design traffic more than 50 msa. ####'),\n",

The stresses, strains and deflections caused at different locations in a pavement by a uniformly distributed single load applied over a circular contact area at the surface of the pavement can be computed using this software. The effect of additional loads (which should also be uniformly distributed loads over circular contact areas) was considered using superposition principle. The single vertical load applied at the surface is described in terms of (a) contact pressure and radius of contact area OR (b) Wheel load and contact pressure OR (c) Wheel load and radius of contact area. For IITPAVE, wheel load and contact pressure are the load inputs. The pavement inputs required are the elastic properties (elastic/resilient moduli and Poisson’s ratio values of all the pavement layers) and the thicknesses of all the layers (excluding subgrade). IITPAVE software, in its current version, can be used to analyze pavements with a maximum of ten layers including the subgrade. If the number of layers in the pavement is more than ten, different layers of similar nature (eg. granular, bituminous) can be combined and considered as one layer. Cylindrical co-ordinate system is followed in the program. Thus, the location of any element in the pavement is defined by (a) depth of the location of the element from the surface of the pavement and (b) the radial distance of the element measured from the vertical axis of symmetry (along the centre of the circular contact area of one wheel load).

It can be seen that solution 3 can be most economical. Practitioners of pavement design should examine various options for pavement design discussed above for the efficient use of materials for a long life pavement. Low strength cementitious GSB permits use of marginal aggregates such as natural river gravels. II.7 stage Construction In this type of construction, thickness of the WMM and GSB is provided for the full design period and the thickness of the bituminous layer is then determined for a shorter design period.

The pavement shall not be allowed to be damaged to an extent of 60% only so that overlay will be effective in extending the life till the design period.

This is avoided if the design is done for the traffic mentioned above and FWD tests done after ten years is to be used for determination of overlay thickness. II.8 Design options for Diversions Pavement for temporary diversion During the construction of culverts, widening of roads and construction of other structures, temporary diversion of highways is needed to allow smooth and safe movement of traffic. Poor quality of pavement of diversion leads to serious accidents. IRC:SP:84 recommends a design traffic of 10 msa for diversion road for four-lane highways. For other categories of single lane or two lane roads, design traffic may be computed from the traffic count for the likely duration of the diversion and minimum design traffic of 2 msa may be adopted for pavement design. Cement treated soil or aggregates with thin bituminous surfacing such as BC/SDBC using the subgrade strain criterion can be used for pavement design. Surface cracks should be sealed with hot bitumen as and when they arise. Heavily loaded commercial vehicles, construction vehicles carrying aggregates and dumpers carrying hot bituminous mixes and dry lean concrete mix, cause maximum distresses to any diversion. Another pavement composition can be cement treated aggregates (minimum 7-day UCS of 1.5 to 3 MPa), a 30 mm sand layer, precast concrete blocks 100 mm thick (IRC:SP:63). Joints between precast concrete blocks should be densely filled with sand and SS-2 bitumen emulsion with 50:50 dilution with water should be poured in the joints to prevent erosion by water. It will also prevent sucking away of jointing sand due to pneumatic wheels. Concrete blocks with bedding sand of 30 mm may be considered to have a modulus of 1000 MPa and the cement treated sub-base may be assigned a modulus of 600 MPa for pavement design. Concrete blocks can be reused for other works after the diversion is no more in use. ####'),\n",

Some of the thicknesses (especially those of bituminous layers) given in the thickness templates in Section 12 of the guidelines and in the following tables have been selected based on the minimum thickness requirement of bituminous layer for pavements with CTB base.

The *** appearing under the bituminous layer fatigue life column indicates that the computed horizontal strain at the bottom of the bituminous layer is ‘compressive’ and thus fatigue performance need not be checked. ####'),\n",

INTRODUCTION 1.1 India is a vast country with diverse geological, climatic regions. Indian road network passes through different terrains including hills and mountains. Hilly regions consist of Himalayan region from North to North-East, the Central Highlands of Aravalli, Western and Eastern Ghats. The Himalayan region on its own covers about a fifth of the country’s total area and about 3000 km of India’s international borders. Hilly regions are generally deprived of Rail and Air connectivity with respect to plain terrain. Hence socio-economic development and strategic needs have resulted in lack of massive road construction programmes in hilly regions and such activities have increased many folds. 1.2 The Hill regions including the road networks are affected more frequently by floods due to torrential rainfall, landslides, snow avalanche etc. which compel many sections of road network closed during rainy season and winter season. 1.3 Design of hill roads need not be restricted to the absolute minimum values set out. Where conditions are favorable and the costs not excessive, use of more liberal values than the minimum should be preferred. 1.4 The recommendation about the Alignment Survey and Geometric Design of Hill Roads was first published in 1973 and revised in 1982 and 2001. 1.5 During the third meeting of Hill Roads and Tunnels Committee (H-10) held in Delhi on 24.05.2018, it was discussed that the IRC:52-2001 “The Alignment Survey and Geometric Design of Hill Roads” is dealing with the same chapters which are covered under IRC:SP:48-1998 “Hill Road Manual”. Accordingly, the Committee decided to revise IRC:52 to incorporate the latest advancement in the field of alignment survey, equipment etc. and reference of the same would be given in IRC:SP:48 which is under revision. The draft was deliberated in various meetings of H-10 Committee and was finalized in its meeting held on 6th October, 2018 for placing before the Highways Specifications and Standards Committee (HSS). The revised draft was placed before the Highways Specifications and Standards Committee (HSS) in its meeting held on 23rd October, 2018. The HSS Committee approved the draft subject to the consideration of the observations of members. The Executive Committee in its meeting held on 27th October, 2018 approved the draft for placing before the Council of IRC. The Council in its 216th meeting held on 22nd November, 2018 at Nagpur (Maharashtra) considered and approved the same for printing.

DEFINITIONS 2.1 Steep Terrain is a terrain where cross slope of the country is generally greater than 60 per cent. 2.2 Mountainous Terrain is a terrain with cross slope greater than 25 and 60 per cent. 2.3 Rolling Terrain is a terrain with cross slope greater than 10 and upto 25 per cent. 2.4 Plain Terrain is terrain where cross slope of the country is generally less than 10 per cent. 2.5 Ruling Gradient is a gradient, which in the normal course must never be exceeded in any part of the road. 2.6 Limiting Gradient is gradient steeper than the ruling gradient which may be used in restricted lengths where keeping within the ruling gradient is not feasible. ####'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'IRC:52-2019', 'page': 3}, page_content='2.7 Exceptional Gradient is gradient steeper than the limiting gradient which may be used in short stretches only in extraordinary situations. 2.8 Escape Gradient is a reverse grade with a crash barrier provided at suitable location adjoining exceptional gradient for stopping of downhill vehicle in case of brake failure. 2.9 Climbing Lane is a lane provided as a separate additional lane for the uphill traffic for safe overtaking while negotiating the reach having continuous exceptional gradient. 2.10 Hair-pin Bend is a bend alignment resulting in reversal of direction of flow of traffic. A bend may be for reversing road direction on same face of hill slope. 2.11 Lateral Clearance is the distance between the extreme edge of the carriageway to the face of the nearest structure/obstruction. 2.12 Ruling Minimum Radius of Curve is the minimum radius of curvature of the centerline of a curve necessary to negotiate a curve at ruling minimum design speed. 2.13 Absolute Minimum Radius of a Curve is the minimum radius of the centerline of a curve necessary to negotiate a curve at absolute minimum design speed. 2.14 Roadway Width is the sum total of carriageway width and shoulder width on either side. It is exclusive of parapets and side drains. 2.15 Road Lane Width refers to the width of carriageway of the road in terms of traffic lanes. Single-lane 3.75 m, Intermediate-lane 5.50 m and double-lane 7.0 m (7.5 m with raised Krebs), multi-lane 3.5 m per additional lane. 2.16 Sight Distance is the distance along the road surface at which a driver has visibility of objects, (stationary or moving) at specified height, above the carriageway. 2.17 Super-elevation is the inward tilt or transverse inclination given to the section of a carriageway on a horizontal curve to reduce the effects of centrifugal force on a moving vehicle. Super-elevation is generally expressed as a slope. 2.18 Transition Length is the centerline length along a curve, radius of which goes on changing at a certain rate of change of acceleration. 2.19 Vertical Clearance is the height above the highest point of the travelling way i.e., the carriageway and part of the shoulders meant for vehicular use, to the lowest point of the overhead structure or rock surface. 2.20 Benching is the formation of a series of level platforms or ledges upon an incline. 2.21 Berm is the horizontal ledge or margin formed at the top or bottom of an earth slope. 2.22 Passing Place is an area provided on the side of the road at convenient locations to facilitate crossing of vehicles approaching from the opposite direction and toe to aside a disabled vehicle so that it does not obstruct traffic. 2.23 Tunnel is a passage through a hill to be used as a road. ####'),\n",

It is, however, not applicable to urban roads or city streets situated in hilly terrain. 3.2 The text deals with two main aspects of hill road construction, namely, alignment surveys for route selection and geometric design of the alignment. The first aspect, namely, the alignment survey including reconnaissance and preliminary surveys etc. are discussed. The various elements of geometric design are covered including brief planning criteria. 4. PLANNING CRITERIA 4.1 Classification of Hill Roads 4.1.1 As in the case of roads in plains, hill roads may be classified as one of the following : (a) National Highways (b) State Highways (c) Major District Roads (d) Other District Roads (e) Village Roads 4.2 Planning of Roads in Hill Areas 4.2.1 Planning of road in hill areas is much different from that in plains. Significantly, large number of villages are sparsely populated and isolatedly located at different altitude unlike in plain areas. It is usually not possible topographically as well as economically to directly link them with motorable roads. Alignment of roads has, thus, to be circuitous and is primarily governed by topography and geological formation. 4.2.2 In hilly areas, road links should be provided on the basis of cluster or group of villages as far as feasible because the population of each village may be very low. Villages located within a radius 1.6 km and having altitude difference of not more than 200 m can be considered as one cluster or groups of villages. Isolated villages, having population more than 250 should be provided with an all-weather link road. For a cluster of villages of population less than 250, a selective approach of an all-weather road may be worked out keeping in view the local conditions. 4.2.3 For new roads, connecting new areas an assessment of traffic likely to be generated can be done by studies on population and consumer needs, development plans for the area and traffic on adjacent roads. 4.3 Ecological Consideration 4.3.1 Construction of roads in hilly region disturbs the ecosystem in many ways. The main ecological problems associated with hill roads construction are : i) Geological disturbances ii) Land degradation, soil erosion and landslides ####'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'IRC:52-2019', 'page': 5}, page_content='iii) Destruction and denuding of forests iv) Interruption and disturbance of drainage pattern v) Loss of forestry and vegetation vi) Aesthetic degradation vii) Siltation of water-reservoirs These factors underline the need to plan, align and construct hill roads after careful thought. The help of geologists and environmental specialists should, therefore, be enlisted while planning for hill roads. Hill Road Manual IRC:SP:48 may be referred for details in this regard. In respect of environmental impact assessment, reference may be made to IRC:SP:19-2001 ‘Manual for Survey, Investigation and Preparation of Road Projects’ and other IRC codes. 5. SURVEY AND ALIGNMENT OF HILL ROADS 5.1 General 5.1.1 In this section, guidelines for carrying out survey work to fix the alignment of hill roads situated primarily in a rural or non-urban area are given. 5.1.2 The requirement of the road is decided based on administrative, developmental, strategic, other needs and the obligatory points to be connected by the road. Control points between obligatory points are governed by saddles, passes, valleys, river crossings, vertical and over-hanging cliffs, forest and cultivated land and other natural features like escarpments, slide- prone, avalanche-prone and other unstable areas. 5.1.3 In order to explore the possibility of various alternative alignments, preliminary investigation shall start from the high obligatory or control summit points and proceed downwards.

The aim shall be to establish a safe, easy, short and economically possible line of communication between the obligatory points considering the physical features of the region and traffic needs apart from least disturbance to the eco-system and the prevailing High Tension line, existing service lines. Ideal road alignment is the one which will cause the least over-all transportation cost including safety for road users taking into account the costs of construction, maintenance, and recurring cost of vehicle operation. 5.1.4 Introduction of hair-pin bends shall be avoided or minimized as far as possible. The bends shall be located on stable hill slopes, and their location in valleys avoided. Series of hair- pin bends on the same face of the hill shall be avoided. 5.1.5 Economy in operating cost of transport vehicles is achieved by adopting easy grades, minimizing rise and fall and by following a direct line as far as possible between obligatory points. Although shortest distance is an important factor, it may have to be sacrificed, at times, in order to obtain easy curvature and gradients, to avoid prohibitive cuts or fills and long river crossings and obstructions. Even a longer road length to ease gradient and curves may result in a more economical operating cost. Therefore economy in operating cost/road safety shall be the governing criteria in selecting the alignment of these roads. ####'),\n",

Typical sketches of machans are shown in Fig. 5.1. Where the rock is steep and inaccessibly deep for construction of machans, temporary pathways can also be developed by driving jumpers of iron rods into the rock-face and putting wooden ballies or planks over them for the men to safely walk along. Fig. 5.1 Machans The speed of construction of trace cut machans depends on the terrain and strength/skill of working party. For guidance and planning purpose, it may be assumed that a working party of about 50 – 100 labourers under a resourceful/imaginative supervisor/officer can achieve a daily progress of about 0.5 to 1.0 km of trace-cut in ordinary soil and 0.25 to 0.5 km in average rocky area, depending on cross slopes and jungle growth. The speed of construction of machans depends on availability of local materials like ballies/bamboos/cane, suitability of location for construction and skill of labourers. A gang of about 20 to 25 labourers can construct about 50 to 60 meters of machans per day in easy locations, whereas the speed can be as low as 10 to 15 meters per day in difficult locations. Where ballies/bamboos are not easily available either because of non-availability or because of restrictions for their extraction, machans may be constructed using pre-fabricated angle iron section of 1.0 m to 1.5 m length which could be easily bolted at site. 5.4.8 Survey procedure The survey shall cover a strip of sufficient width taking into account the degree and extent of cut fill, with some allowance for possible shift in the centre line of the alignment at the time of final design.

GEOMETRIC DESIGN 6.1 General Hill roads have mostly to negotiate through difficult topography, inhospitable terrain and extremes of climatic conditions. As such, design of hill roads to predetermined standards, considering importance of safety and free flow of traffic, is necessary so that travel is safe and comfortable. Geometric design standards have been laid down keeping above in view. 6.1.1 Basic principles of geometric design 6.1.1 Design criteria of hilly terrain shall be applied where stretches of plain/rolling terrain are short and isolated. Similarly, the stretches where hilly terrain intervenes for short and/or isolated stretches in plain/rolling terrain, criteria for such stretches shall be as per standards for plain/rolling terrain. 6.1.2 A uniform application of design standards is desirable for safe and smooth flow of traffic. The use of optimum design standards will reduce the possibility of early obsolescence of the facilities likely to be brought about by inadequacy of the original standards. 6.1.3 As a general rule, geometric features of a highway except cross sectional elements do not lend to stage construction, particularly in the case of hill roads. Improvement of features like grade and curvature at a later date can be very expensive and sometimes be impossible. It is, therefore, necessary that ultimate geometric requirements of hill roads are kept in view right in the beginning. 6.1.4 Development of cross-section in stages is technically feasible. But this shall be decided only after very careful consideration, since hill roads need a lot of protective and drainage works like retaining walls, breast walls, drains of various types and categories etc, consistent with safety and sometimes the road may have to be altogether rebuilt when same is upgraded. If stage construction is unavoidable, better strategy will be to use dry masonry and/or crated masonry for drains, breast walls, pitching etc, locate the interceptor drain well back at the very start and provide culverts to full width formation/roadway to avoid the need for their widening subsequently. However, road being an important part or rather forerunner of all development activities, stage development will become inevitable over a period of time and as such a decision on this issue shall be based on needs for a period of 15-20 years or so. 6.1.5 The design standards indicated are absolute minimum. However, the minimum values shall be applied only where serious restrictions are placed by technical or economic considerations. General effort shall be to exceed the minimum values on safer side to the extent possible. Where the minimum design standards cannot be adopted for inescapable reasons, proper signs shall be put sufficiently in advance to inform the road users. The intention shall be to provide a road to the user with such geometrics which gives safe and reasonably comfortable travel. 6.1.6 The standards have been classified separately for mountainous and steep terrain. Generally, the standards for steep terrain take lower values of design speed, radii of curve etc. ####'),\n",

For this, it is necessary that sight distance of sufficient length is available to permit drivers enough time and distance to control their vehicles to avoid accident. 6.6.2 Two types of sight distances are considered in design of hill roads. Provision of overtaking sight distance is, by and large, not feasible on hill roads and, therefore, this category of sight distance is not discussed further. However, vision berms may be provided by benching on hill sides, in curves to provide better sighting of vehicles wherever felt necessary. The height of bench may be 1.2 m from the crown of the carriageway. These are: a) Stopping sight distance which is the clear distance ahead needed by a driver to bring his vehicle to a stop before meeting a stationary object in his path. It is the sum of braking distance at the particular speed plus the distance travelled by the vehicle during perception and brake reaction time. b) Intermediate sight distance is defined as twice the stopping sight distance. 6.6.3 Design values of both sight distances and criteria for measurement of sight distance are given in Tables 6.5 and 6.6 below : Table 6.5 Design Values of Stopping and Intermediate Sight Distance for Various Speeds <table> <tbody> <tr><td>Speed (km/h)</td><td>Design values – meters </td><td>Design values – meters </td></tr> <tr><td> </td><td>Stopping Sight Distance</td><td>Intermediate Sight Distance</td></tr> <tr><td>20 </td><td>20 </td><td>40 </td></tr> <tr><td>25 </td><td>25 </td><td>50 </td></tr> <tr><td>30 </td><td>30 </td><td>60 </td></tr> <tr><td>35 </td><td>40 </td><td>80 </td></tr> <tr><td>40 </td><td>45 </td><td>90 </td></tr> <tr><td>50 </td><td>60 </td><td>120 </td></tr> </tbody> </table> ####'),\n",

It would be a good practice if this value can be exceeded and visibility corresponding to intermediate sight distance provided in as much length of road as possible. Advantage of intermediate sight distance is that the driver is able to get reasonable opportunities to overtake with caution and driving task becomes much easier. 6.6.5 Though a third category of sight distance i.e. Overtaking Sight distance is considered for roads in plains, it is not normally feasible/practicable on hill roads and hence not dealt with. 6.6.6 Application of site distance criteria for summit vertical curve design is covered in para 6.9.4. On valley curves, the sight distance requirement is governed by night visibility which is discussed in para 6.9.5. Sight distance requirements at horizontal curves are dealt with in para 6.8. 6.7 Clearance 6.7.1 Lateral clearance 6.7.1.1 Desirably the full roadway width at the approaches shall be carried through the underpass. This implies that the minimum lateral clearance (i.e. the distance between the extreme edge of the carriageway and the face of the nearest structure/obstruction) shall be equal to normal shoulder width. On lower category roads in hill areas, having comparatively narrow shoulders, it will be desirable to increase the roadway width at underpasses to a certain extent. 6.7.2 Vertical clearance 6.7.2.1 Minimum vertical clearance of 5.50 meters shall be given over the entire roadway at all underpasses and similarly at overhanging cliffs and semi-tunnel sections. The vertical clearance shall be measured from the highest point of carriageway i.e. crown or superelevated edge to the lowest point of overhead structures/rock out crop.

In the second stage, superelevation is gradually built up over the full width of the carriageway so that required superelevation is available at the beginning of the circular curve. There are three different methods for attaining the superelevation: (i). revolving pavement about the centre line; (ii). Revolving pavement about the inner edge; and (iii). revolving pavement about the outer edge. Plate 1 illustrates these methods diagrammatically. The small cross sections at the bottom of each diagram indicate the pavement cross slope condition at different points. 6.8.2.8 Each of the above methods is applicable under different conditions. Method (i). which involves least distortion of the pavement will be found suitable in most of the situations where there are no physical controls, and may be adopted in the normal course. Method (ii). is preferable where the lower edge profile is a major control, e.g. on account of drainage. Where overall appearance is the criterion, method (iii) is preferable since the outer edge profile, which is most noticeable to drivers, is not distorted. 6.8.2.9 The superelevation shall be attained gradually over the full length of the transition curve, so that the design superelevation is available at the starting point of the circular portion. Sketches in Plate 3 have been drawn on this basis.

The widening has two components i.e. Mechanical widening to compensate the extra width occupied by the vehicle due to tracking of rear wheels and Psychological widening to permit easy crossing of vehicles, since vehicles tend to wander more on curve. Both the components are to be taken care of in double lane and mechanical components on single lane roads. However, at blind curves double-laning may be considered. 6.8.5.2 Extra width to be provided on horizontal curves is given in Table 6.10. Table 6.10.

Lack of visibility in the lateral direction may arise due to obstructions like walls, cut slopes, wooded areas, high crops, etc. Set-back distance from the centre line of the carriageway, within which offending obstructions shall be cleared, to ensure the needed visibility, can be determined as given in para 6.8.6.2. However, in certain cases, due to variations in alignment, road cross- section and the type and location of obstructions, it may become necessary to resort to field measurements to fix the exact limits of clearance. 6.8.6.2 The set-back-distance is calculated from the following equation (see Fig. 6.11 for definitions): m = R-(R-n) Cos θ where = radians; m = the min i m u m set-back distance to sight obstruction in meters (measured from the centre line of the road); R = radius at centre line of the road in meters n = distance between the centre line of the road and the centre line of the inside lane in meters; and S = sight distance in meters ####'),\n",

These lanes may be useful in bringing the vehicles to halt in case of emergency due to brake failure.

Congestion effects are greatest on long steep gradients. The situation is particularly difficult in India because of the presence of overloaded trucks and buses with very low power-to- weight ratios. In such circumstances, the provision of an auxiliary climbing lane can be extremely beneficial to enable vehicles travelling up the gradient to overtake safety and efficiently. Thus climbing lanes may be provided wherever necessary in order to address the necessity of making available a separate lane for safe overtaking for vehicle travelling uphill, in reaches having continuous exceptional gradients.

Tunnels are also constructed under a river or waterway, mostly in an urban area. For detailed planning and design, IRC:SP:91 be referred. However, preliminary steps for tunnel planning are as follows: 7.1 Surveys Topographical survey helps in identifying land features and for selecting the most suitable tunnel alignment. Traverse network connecting the existing survey control on each side of the hill to a high degree of accuracy is necessary for establishing the ground control for the tunnel alignment. 7.2 Accuracy Director, Geodetic and Research Branch, Survey of India have issued technical instructions regarding horizontal control survey for tunnels, where it is stated that an accuracy of 1:30,000 for outer horizontal control should be aimed at. 7.3 Mapping The mapping around both the proposed portal locations shall be conducted by EDM survey for maintaining the desired accuracy. Sufficient area around both the portal locations shall be covered on a scale of 1:1000 with a contour interval of 1 m to have a better appreciation of the topography around the portal location for planning the suitable geometry of the tunnel alignment and location of portals, bore hole locations and other permanent structures. Proposed tunnel alignment shall also be marked on the contour plans prepared around both portal locations. 7.4 Ideal Tunnel Portal Layout The important criteria for locating the portal are the existence of sound rock conditions with adequate cover. The rock mass should be free from any fault/dislocation and the loose fractured zones/layers should not be sloping towards the portals. Further, the location of a portal should be such that it is not affected by landslides ensuring the approaches to the portal in stable formation requiring least open cut excavation/ground stabilization measures. ####'),\n",

This is seldom possible, but the introduction of sharp curves, particularly in conjunction with steep gradients should be avoided, even if it means a longer tunnel. If horizontal curves become unavoidable, a minimum radius of 200 m could be adopted. Only in exceptional cases, this should be reduced to 100 m. (ii) Gradients: The gradients of the roadway are of primary importance, since in most cases they constitute a determining factor in the length of tunnel, and hence its cost. In general, it is sought to employ gradients which will not cause congestion through the excessive slowing down of heavy vehicles. (iii) Cross-section of tunnel: The internal cross-sectional dimensions of a road tunnel are determined by the following considerations: (a) the number and width of traffic lanes making up the carriageway; (b) the vertical headroom for vehicles; (c) the space to be provided for ventilation ducts, walkways, lighting, and drainage and for fire and other services. Long tunnels should have a good longitudinal gradient for effective drainage, 0.2 per cent is satisfactory. Long tunnels, which are more than 300 m length, should not have a gradient steeper than 4 per cent. With tunnels less than 300 m long, a straight fall should be adopted. However, two outward falling gradient are permitted for a tunnel over 300 m long. (iv) Ventilation: Ventilation is one of the most important factors in the design of road tunnels. There are two main requirements: ####'),\n",

(2) A good standard of visibility must be maintained in the tunnel for the safety and comfort of drivers. Road vehicles passing through a tunnel emit fumes, which need to be cleared quickly. Artificial ventilation becomes necessary in tunnels above 400 m length. The ventilation system should be capable of producing a fresh air input of 0.5 cum per meter length of the tunnel.

The driver entering a tunnel should be able to adjust himself to the artificial lighting conditions inside the tunnel. Similarly, the driver leaving a tunnel should be able to adjust himself to the natural light outside the tunnel.

Accident experience and vehicle operations (usually truck) on the grade combined with engineering judgment are frequently used as the determinant for an escape ramp. Escape lanes may be built at any feasible location where the main road alignment is in transition. They should be built in advance of main lane curvature that cannot be negotiated safely by an out of control vehicle and in advance of populated areas. Escape lanes should exit to be left side of the main line. For new and existing facilities and until local criteria are available it may be useful to adopt the AASHTO criteria. The most commonly used escape ramp is the ascending type with an arrester bed, Fig. A.2.1. Ramp installations of ascending type use gradient resistance to advantage, supplementing the effects of the aggregate in the arrester bed, and generally reducing the length of ramp necessary to stop the vehicle. The loose bedding material in arrester bed increases the rolling resistance and bedding serves to hold the vehicle in place on the ramp grade it has came to stop. Escape ramp should be designed for speed range of 50 to 120 km per hour. The design of escape lane should consider the following criteria: Fig. A.2.1 Typical Type of Emergency Escape Ramp - Safety stop an out-of-control vehicle and the length of ramp must be sufficient to dissipate the kinetic energy of the moving vehicle. - Alignment of escape ramp should be tangent or be very flat curvature to relieve the driver of undue vehicle control problems. - Width of ramp should be adequate to accommodate more than one vehicle because it is not uncommon for two or more vehicles to have need of the escape ####'),\n",

Widths of ramps in use range from 3.6 m to 12 m. - Surfacing material used in arrester bed should be clean, easily compacted and have high coefficient of rolling resistance. Layout of arrester bed adjacent to carriageway is shown in Fig. A.2.2. - Entrance to the ramp must be designed so that vehicle traveling at a high rate of speed can enter safely. - Advance sign is required to inform the driver about the existence of the escape ramp well in advance so that a decision whether or not to use the ramp may be taken. Regulatory sign near the entrance should be used to discourage other motorists from entering, stopping or parking at the ramp. Proper illumination of the approach is desirable. - The characteristic that makes a truck escape ramp an effective safety device also makes it difficult to retrieve a vehicle captured by the ramp. Ideally a service road located adjacent to arrester bed is needed so that recovery vehicle and maintenance vehicles can use it without becoming trapped in the material.

INTRODuCTION 1.1 The role of delineators is to provide visual assistance to drivers about alignment of the road ahead, especially at night. Delineators are particularly effective in the case of complex locations involving changes in horizontal/vertical geometry, and during severe weather conditions such as heavy rain, fog or snow. Normally, reflectors are used on the delineators for better night time visibility. 1.2 In a broad sense, “delineation” stands for any device or treatment whose aim is to outline the roadway or a portion thereof. This could include painted lines, raised pavement markers, posts, post-mounted reflectors or contrast treatments of the pavement. Delineation by pavement markings is covered by IRC:35, “Code of Practice for Road Markings”. This code deals only with post type retro reflective delineators or embedded on any concrete structures/trees. 1.3 The code was first published by IRC in 1981. A need was felt to update the document keeping in view of the new and improved materials which are now available. A Sub-group consisting of Shri Pawan Kumar Singh (as Convener of the Sub-group) along with Dr. S. Velmurugan, Shri S.K. Popli, Dr. P.K. Agarwal and Shri Parampreet Singh as members was constituted to prepare the draft revision document. The draft prepared by the Sub-group was considered by the H-7 committee (personnel given below) at its meeting held on 10th October 2018. The Convener was authorized to forward the same to IRC after modifying further in the light of the deliberations for placing before the Highways Specifications and Standards (HSS) Committee. Subsequently, HSS Committee considered and approved the draft in its meeting held on 23rd October, 2018. The revised draft incorporating the comments of HSS was approved by the 216th Council in its meeting held on 22nd November, 2018 at Nagpur (Maharashtra) for printing. Singh, Nirmaljit ……..

SCOPE 2.1 Delineators are classified under three types: (i) Roadway Indicators (ii) Median Markers (iii) Hazard Markers, and (iv) Object Markers 2.2 Each of these serves a somewhat different purpose. “Roadway indicators” are intended to delineate the edges of the roadway to guide drivers about the alignment ahead, particularly where it might be confusing for some reason. The objective of “hazard markers” is to define obstructions like guard-rails and abutments adjacent to the carriageway, for instance at culverts and bridges which are narrower than the roadway width at approaches. “Object markers” are used to indicate hazards and obstructions within the vehicle flow path, for example channelizing islands close to the intersections, roundabouts at the intersections or electric poles or trees located within the Right of Way (RoW). 2.3 At the same time, it is to be borne in mind that the delineators are basically driving aids and should not be regarded as a substitute for warning signs, road markings, or barriers for out-of-control vehicles. 3. ROADWAY INDICATORS Design 3.1 Roadway indicators are popularly called as Delineators or Guide Poles. It is basically a form of guide posts made of Mild steel with pure polyester powder coating with the minimum thickness of powder coating of not less than 40 micron for protection against corrosion. The surface should be concealed so that there should not be any exposed surface without powder coating. Alternatively, these metal guide poles can be concealed with thermoplastic body which is of course somewhat cost prohibitive. The posts shall have an ellipsoidal or circular design with the height of the pole shall be 800 to 900 mm above the ground with about 200 to 300 mm base which can be anchored onto the ground. Mild steel Guide Poles shall conform to Type XI sheeting specifications as per IRC:67 and ASTM D 4956 which would ensure to obtain clear visibility of the road alignment during night time (refer Fig. 1).

Such temporary delineators shall have three stripes of retro reflective sheeting (each stripe with 150 sq cm or above) of Type XI conforming to IRC:67 and ASTM D-4956 which would ensure clear visibility during night time as shown in Fig. 3. 3.4 These guide poles shall be always retro reflective in nature as it helps to improve visibility at night and at locations where visibility is poor due to fog etc. As mentioned earlier, the posts should have alternate band of black colour paint and white retro reflective sheeting of Type XI as per IRC:67 and ASTM D-4956. White colored retro reflective sheeting should be fixed on reverse side of posts in the case of undivided carriageways having sharp curves. Application 3.5 The decision to use roadway indicators, whether continuously or in short sections selectively, will be guided by factors such as importance of the road, quantum of fast traffic, speed of travel, road crash records, danger posed by any specific deficiency in the road alignment, etc. The primary use of roadway indicators in non-urban sections of main roads is especially in curved reaches. However, in the urban stretches, the use of delineators could be decided based on warrants of the road and traffic conditions including the road stretches which are not adequately lighted. Application photographs are given in Fig. 4. 3.6 In situations where a guard-rail or parapet wall is provided for safety, roadway indicators shall be mounted above or immediately behind the guard-rail.

SCOPE 2.1 The guidelines cover the layout and design of river training works and approach embankment protection works for ensuring safety of the bridges and their approaches. These guidelines also deal with some of the construction and maintenance aspects. Protection works for open and shallow foundations are also covered. These guidelines also cover the river training works for rivers in mountainous regions. 2.2 The scope of these guidelines is limited only to some salient aspects of design and construction of the protection works mentioned above and does not extend to the much wider associated problems of river behavior, control and bridge hydraulics, etc. 2.3 The necessity or otherwise of the guide bunds, spurs and other protective works must be decided judiciously after observing the behavior of the river at the site under consideration. Data about the protection works at other sites on upstream or downstream of the site under consideration can also be a good guide. River training works are costly and their maintenance cost is also very high. In case, their location, configuration and size are not decided properly, these works can cause damaging effects also. Therefore, these must be provided judiciously. The river behavior near bridges must be studied and analyzed for proper design of river training works. For bridges across major rivers like Brahmaputra, Kosi, Yamuna and Ganga, the extent and configuration of the protective works should be decided with the help of physical models. For accuracy, the results obtained from physical models may be further checked on mathematical models preferably, by the same research station which carried out physical model studies. 2.4 Given inadequate knowledge of uncertainties about many aspects of bridge hydraulics and river behavior and characteristics in general, these guidelines cannot obviously claim to ####'),\n",

These are to be deemed as a guide to good practice of design and construction of the protection works compatible with the current experience and knowledge in the subject area. For particular applications, these guidelines may have to be modified and supplemented in each case based on subjective and objective judgement of the engineer, to cater for site, river and specific requirements of a bridge structure. 3. TERmINOLOGY The following definitions shall apply for the purpose of these guidelines. (i) Afflux/backwater: The rise in flood level of the river immediately on the upstream of the bridge as a result of obstruction to natural flow caused by the construction of the bridge and its approaches. (ii) Alluvial streams: A stream whose bed and banks are composed of loose granular material, that has been deposited by the stream and can be picked up and transported again by the current during the floods, and is said to flow through incoherent alluvium, may be briefly referred to as an alluvial stream. (iii) Approach road protection: Approaches are protected by means of pitching, gabions and turfing against ravages due to wind, rain-cuts, wave action, erosive action of parallel flow or frontal attack of a river. Further, where a bridge with constricted water- way is located in a wide khadir, guide bunds alone may not afford protection to the entire length of approaches from the river flow. In such cases, approaches beyond the influence zone of guide bunds may need protection. (iv) Floor protection works: Protection in the form of flooring where adoption of shallow foundations, becomes economical by restricting the scour. (v) Guide bunds: These are embankments meant to confine and guide the river flow past a bridge without causing damage to it and its approaches. These are generally constructed in the direction of flow on one or both flanks, depending on the site conditions. (vi) Khadir: The maximum width over which the river meanders during high floods is known as Khadir width of the river. (vii) Meander: The curvature of flow, established in a stream either due to its own characteristics or due to impressed external forces. (viii) River bank protection: Bank protection is afforded directly in the form of slope pitching, gabions and turfing or indirectly in the form of spurs. (ix) Spurs or Groynes: These are structures constructed transverse to the flow of the river and extend from the bank into the river. These are intended to induce silting and diverting the flow away from the point of attack. (x) Design Flood level: It is the high flood level corresponding to design flood pertaining to different return periods (xi) Meandering river: A meander is one of a series of regular sinuous curves, bends, loops, turns, or windings in the channel of a river, stream, or other watercourse. It is produced by a stream or river swinging from side to side as it flows across its floodplain or shifts its channel within a valley. ####'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'IRC:89-2019', 'page': 4}, page_content='(xii) Braiding river: A braiding river, or braiding channel, consists of a network of river channels separated by small, and often temporary, islands called braid bars Braided streams occur in rivers with low slope and/or large sediment load. (xiii) River Morphology: The term river morphology and its synonym fluvial geomorphology are used to describe the shapes of river channels and how they change in shape and direction over time. The rivers of India reveal certain special characteristics because they undergo large seasonal fluctuations in flow and sediment load. The rivers are adjusted to an array of discharges, and most rivers exhibit morphologies that are related to high-magnitude floods. Major large rivers in India, namely Brahmaputra, Kosi, Ganga, Yamuna and Narmada, have received greater attention from fluvial geomorphologists. Understanding of river behavior is complicated due to integrated geo-morphologic, hydrologic, hydraulic and sediment parameters. It may be observed that the different plan forms i.e. straight, meandering, braided etc. depend on the river geometry, sediment load, slope and flow in the river. 4. SITE DATA The following details are a general guideline for the data to be collected for design purpose. However, the nature and extent of the data to be collected would vary depending upon the importance of the bridge/project. 4.1 Topographical Data (i) An Index map, to a suitable small scale (topo sheets from Survey of India scale 1 in 50,000 or 1 in 250,000 would do in most cases) showing the proposed project location, reach under consideration, the existing means of communication, the general topography of the country and important towns, any other existing or proposed structure across or along the river, etc., in the vicinity of the proposed works. The satellite imageries of 30 m resolution are apt to understand the reach under consideration. The satellite imagery shows the present general topography and recent changes in the reach of the river. A record of satellite imaginaries can be collected from National remote Sensing Centre in Hyderabad or from any other agency. (ii) River survey plans, preferably to a scale 1/10,000 for a river reach of at least two meander lengths upstream and one meander length downstream. In case the bridge is situated immediately downstream of the confluence of two rivers, the reach to be considered in respect of both should be at least 1.5 km upstream of the extent of back water influence in the tributaries under highest flood level. (iii) A contoured site plan, to a suitable scale showing the location of the bridge and covering approaches to a sufficient distance (not less than 500 m on either side beyond the Khadir width in the case of a bridge across major river), the direction of flow, names of nearest inhabited localities, references to the bench marks used as datum, location of trial pits for borings and the location of nullahs, wells and outcrop of rocks and the existence of structures upstream and downstream of the river.

In general, these are aligned in line with the axis of bridge up to high defined banks. In case the alignment of road must be given a curve before reaching the high defined banks, it has to be provided towards the downstream side and not towards upstream side. 5.2.3 Classification of guide bunds: Guide bunds can be classified: (i) According to their form in plan, and (ii) According to their geometrical shape. 5.2.3.1 According to form in plan: The guide bunds can be divergent, convergent, parallel and elliptical as shown in Fig. 5.1. (i) Divergent guide bunds: They exercise an attracting influence on flow and they may be used where the river has already formed a loop and the approaching flow has become oblique. However, they have a tendency of shoal formation at center due to larger waterway between the curved heads. The approach embankment gets comparatively lesser protection in the case of worst possible embayment compared to equal bank length of parallel guide bunds, (Fig. 5.2). therefore, require a longer length in comparison to parallel guide bunds for the same degree of protection to approach embankments and so, shall be used, only when found necessary. (ii) Convergent guide bunds: Convergent guide bunds have disadvantage of excessive attack and heavy scour at the head and shoaling all along the shank, rendering the end bays inactive. These should be avoided as far as possible. (iii) Parallel guide bunds: Parallel guide bunds with suitable curve heads have been found to give uniform flow from the head of the guide bund to the axis of the bridge and so these are generally preferred.

INTRODUCTION Airfield pavements are one of the most important assets of any Nation. Keeping these national assets operational all the time has strategic importance. The IRC prepared IRC: 105 “Tentative Specification for Bituminous Concrete (Asphaltic Concrete) for Airfield Pavements” in the year 1988. However, with the induction of New Large Aircrafts and heavy weight fighter aircrafts with high tyre pressure and single wheel landing gear, a need has emerged to revise the technical specifications of different asphalt pavement layers in the airfield pavement. Besides reducing fatigue cracking, these high-quality pavement layers would increase the service life of the pavement. Sophisticated and high-speed weigh batch hot mix asphalt plants available in the industry can ensure a high degree of quality output conforming to the mix design parameters. This high-quality material can be rapidly paved with the new technology paving and compacting equipment available. Hence need was felt to revise this document. According, the task of revision of this document was entrusted to Flexible Pavement, Airfield & Runways Committee (H-2) of IRC during tenure 2018-20. The initial draft was prepared by the subgroup comprising Col. R.S. Bhanwala and Shri Manoj Kumar Shukla. Later H-2 Committee co-opted officers Col. Kulbir Singh, MES and Shri Manoj Kumar Garg, AAI in the sub group. The draft was further deliberated in various meetings of H-2 Committee.

Scope and Summary of Test Method This method covers preparation of compacted bituminous mixtures and the measurement of the change of diametral tensile strength resulting from the effects of water saturation and laboratory accelerated stripping phenomenon with a freeze-thaw cycle. The result may be used to predict long-term stripping susceptibility of bituminous mixtures and evaluate liquid anti-stripping additives that are added to bitumen or pulverized mineral materials such as hydrated lime, which are added to the mineral aggregate. Each set of 6 compacted specimens is divided into two equal subsets. One subset is tested in dry condition for indirect tensile strength. The other subset is subjected to vacuum saturation and a freeze-thaw cycle (thawing in a hot water bath) before testing for indirect tensile strength. Numerical indices of retained indirect tensile strength properties are calculated from the test data obtained by testing the two subsets: dry and conditioned. 2.

Scope and Summary of the Test Method This test method covers the determination of the theoretical maximum specific gravity and density of uncompacted bituminous paving mixtures at 25ºC. The theoretical maximum specific gravity (Gmm) is used: (a) to calculate air voids in compacted bituminous mixtures, (b) to calculate the amount of bitumen absorbed by the aggregate, and (c) to provide target value for the compaction of paving mixtures in the field. A sample of loose paving mixture is placed in a tarred vacuum vessel. Water at 25ºC is added to completely submerge the sample. A specified amount of vacuum is gradually applied to remove the air bubbles entrapped between asphalt mix particles. After the vacuum is released, the volume of the sample of the void less paving mixture is obtained by either immersing the vacuum container with the sample in a water bath and weighing or by filling the calibrated vacuum container level full of water and weighing in air. 2.

These codes were based on linear elastic theory. The last revisions of these two WSM documents were carried out in the year 2000. Further, considering unprecedented growth of knowledge in the field of concrete bridge technology, development of new structural forms, new methods of computer-based analysis and design and development of high strength materials, IRC decided to revise the bridge codes using the Limit State Method (LSM). Accordingly, it was decided to rationalize all Indian bridge codes, to the Limit State approach, in line with international practices. The B-4 Committee worked on this task from the year 2001 and finally the first concrete code on LSM was published in 2011. This is a unified code covering various types of concrete bridges, using plain concrete, reinforced concrete, and prestressed concrete, constructed by cast-in-place precast method. This LSM philosophy is an advancement over the traditional design philosophies. It allows us to check that the structure remains fit for use throughout its design life by remaining within the acceptable limit of safety, serviceability and durability requirements based on the risks involved. Subsequently, IRC also published an explanatory handbook as Special Publication IRC:SP:105 with the aim to help users and provide guidance on the interpretation and use of IRC:112 along with worked-out examples. In addition, numerous special publications on subjects like Voided Slab Construction (IRC:SP:64), Segmental Bridges (IRC:SP:65), Continuous Bridges (IRC:SP:66), Use of High Performance Concrete (IRC:SP:70), Precast Pre-tensioned Girders (IRC:SP:71), were also changed to LSM philosophy and published by IRC for the use and benefit of engineers. The publication on External and Unbonded Prestressing Tendons in Bridge Structures is currently under updation to LSM (IRC:SP:67). With the publication of this new concrete LSM code, the existing IRC:18 and IRC:21, both the working loads/allowable stress method codes have been withdrawn by IRC. However, considering the need for a smooth transition and gradual acquaintance of practicing engineers with the new LSM Code, as an alternative, the working stress method design was also allowed and was given in an annexure to IRC:112 with a rider that the option of using Annexure-4 was to be exercised by the owner, and that it would be available till it was withdrawn. After receiving feedback on the usage of IRC:112 till 2016 from various stakeholders and also considering the policy circular of Ministry of Road Transport and Highways (MORTH) No. RW-NH- 35075/9/2006-S&R (B) dated 2nd September 2016 vide which it was decided that all bridges to be constructed on National Highways, shall be designed as per IRC:112 following the ‘Limit State Design Philosophy’ except those components for which IRC codes and standards based on limit state approach were not available.

The requirements specified in the Code aim at achieving construction of safe, serviceable, durable and economical bridges. It covers design principles, detailed design criteria and practical rules, material specifications, workmanship, quality control and all such aspects which affect the characteristics/ ability of the bridge to meet the aims. This Code deals with the structural use of plain cement concrete, reinforced concrete, prestressed concrete and composite construction using concrete elements in bridges and is applicable to all structural elements using normal weight concrete (density in the range of 24 ± 4 kN/m3) and made using cements, aggregate, mineral admixtures, chemical admixtures and water, as given in the Section dealing with material specifications in the Code. All provisions of the Code may not be applicable for hybrid structural systems, or for structures using other types of concrete. However, for concrete portion of hybrid elements/structures and for other type of concrete, relevant provision of this Code may be used. The term “other types of concrete” includes, but is not restricted to: (1) Light Weight Concrete (density <20 kN/m3) and Heavy Weight Concrete (density >28 kN/m3).

(2) Execution is carried out by personnel having appropriate qualification, skill and experience. (3) Adequate supervision and quality control are provided during all stages of design and construction.

It should withstand all actions, consisting of applied and induced loads as well as environmental influences liable to occur, retaining its structural integrity, and also withstand accidental loads (e.g. barge impact/vehicular impact) and earthquake loads without causing damage, which is disproportionate to the causative event. Adequacy of performance is defined in terms of serviceability, safety, durability and economy. 5.1.2 Reliability aspects and codal approach The term ‘degree of reliability’ is used to indicate the acceptably low level of probability of failure in meeting the expected performance during a specified period of time. Determination of the reliability measured in terms of statistical probability requires knowledge of statistical parameters which define loading and material strengths. This data together with knowledge of structural models of resistance enable evaluation of structural performance in probabilistic terms. At the present state of knowledge, determination of reliability is possible only in limited load cases for simple structures. The Code, therefore, strives to achieve the desirable degree of reliability by approximate methods based upon a combination of the following: (1) Known statistical parameters describing properties of materials and actions. (2) Deterministic models of structural behaviour. (3) The international practices and past experience of acceptable/unacceptable performance of structures. (4) Partial factors for actions and resistance models based on calibration and rationalisation of existing international practices. 5.1.3 Safety, serviceability, durability and economy The requirements of the Code directly address safety, serviceability and durability aspects. Economy is indirectly addressed by: (1) Allowing maximum exploitation of materials and specifying use of technologies which are consistent with the minimum/desirable standards of safety, serviceability and durability, (2) Accepting appropriate levels of economic risks while specifying performance levels by taking into consideration different design situations, load combinations (events), importance of structure in view of consequences of failure, and by specifying different intended design lives for replaceable and non-replaceable parts. ####'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'IRC:112-2020', 'page': 16}, page_content='5.2 Limit State Philosophy of Design (1) The response of the structure when subjected to different magnitudes of loads lies in different states (domains). ‘Limit States’ are defined as limits of domains beyond which the structure does not meet specified performance criteria. In ‘Limit State Philosophy’ of design, various boundaries of acceptable/unacceptable performance are defined together with the circumstances in which such performances are expected. (2) Two basic groups of limit states are considered: (a) Ultimate Limit States (ULS): These limit states cover static equilibrium and failure of structural elements or structure as a whole, when acted upon by ‘ultimate design loads’. (b) Serviceability Limit States (SLS): These limit states deal with the condition of the structure subjected to influence of ‘serviceability design loads’. These conditions include level of internal stress, fatigue failure, deflection, damage to structural element such as cracking and discomfort to users due to vibrations. (3) The representative values of actions and combination of actions representing different design situations are defined. The representative values of loads are modified by using load factors for each of the basic limit states, which are then combined using combination factors. The combination factors take into account the probability of simultaneous occurrence of loads. (4) The response of the structure is calculated using principles of mechanics and simplified established models describing behavior of concrete members. These methods also account for inherent geometric variations which are kept within acceptable construction tolerances. (5) The response of the structure is required to lie within acceptable domain for different combinations of actions. (6) The structure designed by following this philosophy, and constructed by satisfying other stipulations of the Code are deemed to meet the general performance requirements stipulated in Clause 5.1.1. 5.3 Limit States The structure shall be designed for the following limit states: 5.3.1 Ultimate limit states (ULS) 5.3.1.1 Limit state of equilibrium When subjected to various design combinations of ultimate loads, the bridge or any of its components considered as a rigid body, shall not become unstable. 5.3.1.2 Limit state of strength The bridge or any of its components shall not lose its capacity to sustain the various ultimate load combinations by excessive deformation, transformation into a mechanism, rupture, crushing or buckling. ####'),\n",

The stresses are to be estimated using resistance models to represent the behaviour of structure, as stipulated in the Code. 5.3.2.2 Limit state of crack control (1) The cracking of reinforced, partially prestressed, and prestressed concrete structures under serviceability load combinations is kept within acceptable limits of crack widths in such a way as not to adversely affect the durability or impair the aesthetics. (2) Alternatively, the control of cracking is deemed to be satisfied by following restrictions on amount and spacing of reinforcement. 5.3.2.3 Limit state of deformation (1) The deformation of the bridge or its elements when subjected to combination of design actions shall not adversely affect the proper functioning of its elements, appurtenances, and riding quality. (2) Deformations during construction shall be controlled to achieve proper geometry of finished structure. 5.3.2.4 Limit state of vibration (1) For footbridges or component of bridges specifically designed to carry footway loading, the direct verification of vibration limits is required, for which specialist literature may be referred. (2) For special types of bridges and their components dynamic effects under action of wind are required to be calculated and verified to be within acceptable limits. Model tests are required under certain circumstances. (3) For other types of bridges, the limit state of vibration under serviceability load combinations is deemed to be satisfied by limiting deflection of elements. 5.3.2.5 Limit state of fatigue The bridge or any of its components shall not loose its capacity to carry design loads by virtue of its materials reaching fatigue limits due to its loading history. For carrying out fatigue verification, specialist literature may be referred. However, fatigue verification is not necessary for the following: (a) For Reinforced concrete structures when the stress in the tensile reinforcement is less than 300 MPa under Rare Combination of Serviceability Limit State as against 0.8 f specified in y clause no. 12.2.2. (b) For prestressed concrete structures under the frequent combination of action and prestressing force, only compressive stresses occur at the extreme concrete fibres, under Serviceability Limit State. ####'),\n",

(2) Actions are classified: (a) By their variation in time (duration of application) : - Permanent Actions (G), e.g. self-weight, - Variable Actions (Q), e.g. imposed live loads, - Accidental Actions (A), e.g. barge impact load. Some variable actions, acting for long durations are treated on par with permanent actions. These are called ‘Quasi-Permanent’ actions. (b) By their nature and/or by response of the structure to them: - Static actions are those which do not cause significant acceleration of members on which they act. - Dynamic actions are those which cause significant acceleration of members on which they act. Some dynamic actions can be represented by ‘Quasi-Static’ actions, which are the static values producing equivalent or representative response (stress/ deformation) in the structure caused by the dynamic action. (3) Prestressing force (P) is a permanent action with time-dependent variation. 5.4.2 Characteristic and combinational values of actions 5.4.2.1 Characteristic value The characteristic value of an action is generally the main representative value, which can be based upon the statistical distribution of magnitudes of action (e.g. a mean value, or upper or lower fractile value). Alternatively, a representative ‘nominal value’ is specified which is treated as a characteristic value. A single value is generally specified, except where the design is sensitive to variation of magnitude in which case lower and upper values (also referred to as ‘inferior’ and ‘superior’ values respectively) are also specified in addition to mean value. These may be specified as absolute values or as a multiple of characteristic value. 5.4.2.2 Combinational value (1) A structure during its construction and service life is acted upon by various direct or indirect actions at different times in different combinations, representing various design situations. Some of these situations are represented by a few combinations chosen for design checks, for which the response of the structure is calculated and verified not to exceed the limit states. ####'),\n",

All components of the structure are not required to be verified for all limit states and all possible combinations. The requirements or exemptions are covered under relevant clauses of the Code dealing with such components. 5.5 Representative Values of Properties of Materials 5.5.1 General The constituent materials of structure acting singly or in a composite action with other materials have certain properties which determine their own response and the behaviour of the structural elements when acted upon by various loads. Some of the material and structural properties depend upon the type of load, its duration, magnitude and the loading history. Some properties are time-dependent, while others are affected by environmental actions. Some properties depend upon the physical size (dimensions) of the structural member. Almost all the properties exhibit statistical variation in their numerical values. Many of the properties show strong co-relations with other properties, which permit sufficiently accurate, if not exact, estimation of their value from the values of other properties by use of mathematical expressions. Correlations are based on laboratory or field observations and statistical regression analysis. A few of these properties are chosen as descriptive and/or representative properties of the materials (e.g. self compacting concrete). They are often used to define the material itself or its grade (e.g. concrete grade M40 and reinforcing steel Fe500). Standard methods of testing for measuring such values are specified by Bureau of Indian Standards or other national / international authorities. 5.5.2 Representative values Depending upon the purpose of carrying out the evaluation, one or more of the following three representative values are used in the design: (1) Average or statistical mean value. (2) A lower fractile value (inferior value) based on the statistical distribution function or the statistical mean value suitably reduced by a factor. (3) An upper fractile value (superior value) based on the statistical distribution function or the statistical mean value suitably increased by a factor. The representative values of commonly used materials are defined in Section 6. 5.5.3 Other methods of assessment of properties When higher level of accuracy is desired in evaluating response of the structure, use of more accurate values of other properties than those obtained from co-relations used in Section 6 and Annexure A-2 are required.

(2) Laboratory/field testing using standard methods of testing and measurements and based on sufficient number of tests as required by statistical methods of establishing desired accuracy (usually 95 percent confidence level). Normally, to establish mean and standard deviation, not less than 30 samples are required. 5.6 Analytical Methods to Evaluate Behaviour of Structures 5.6.1 Global analysis of structure The purpose of this analysis is the verification of overall stability and establishment of effects of action on the whole or a part of the structure. These effects include the distribution of internal forces and moments as well as stresses, strains, curvatures, rotations and displacements in static or dynamic modes. To carry out analysis the geometry, boundary conditions, behaviour of the structure and its components need to be idealised. The structure is idealised by considering it as made up of elements which can be linear, two dimensional or three dimensional. Classical methods of mechanics or modern techniques such as finite element can be used for analysis. The mathematical model should be capable of evaluating the desired effect with sufficient accuracy. 5.6.2 Local analyses In addition to global analysis of structure or its elements, local analyses will be necessary particularly in the regions of stress concentrations and geometric discontinuities. 5.6.3 Idealisation, modelling and adequacy Behaviour of structure and its components can be represented to various degrees of accuracy. The general principles as well as normally used methods are covered in Section 7. The idealisation and modelling should be adequate to estimate the relevant action effects. The interaction of properties of constituent materials with heterogeneous properties should be appropriately taken into account. Appropriate methods of analysis such as elastic analysis, non-elastic analysis with limited redistribution, plastic analysis with actual or idealised material properties are indicated depending upon the level of accuracy required. Necessity of including the second order effects in the analysis is indicated where it is important. 5.7 Design Based on Full Scale Testing Design of some elements like crash barriers, fenders, prestressing anchors, etc., can be based on full scale tests of the prototype.

Unless otherwise specifically classified by Owner, all structures shall be designed for a design life of 100 years. 5.8.2 Use of appropriate values of time-dependent material properties Variation of strengths such as reduction of concrete strength by sustained loading as well as degradation of materials, effects of creep and shrinkage of concrete, relaxation of steel and fatigue are some of the time dependent design properties. The values of such time dependent properties to be used in the design shall take into account design service life. 5.8.3 Specification of actions and action-effects For actions of environmental origin, appropriate return period is specified depending on the design life. The probability of failure during life of structure depends on the return period of load, the design life and probability of failure in unit period for the specified design value of load (unit period of one year and return period expressed in years are normally used). 5.8.4 Control of properties of materials The permissible limits of known harmful elements in acceptable and durable materials are specified in Section 14. 5.8.5 Control of attack on materials by aggressive elements under different atmospheric conditions Certain aggressive chemical elements in the surrounding environment such as oxygen, carbon-dioxide, sulphates and chlorides penetrate concrete and cause corrosion of steel in concrete. The moisture content in concrete and temperature directly affect the process of corrosion. The depth of penetration of these harmful elements into concrete depends on the permeability of concrete and time. The process of deterioration is mitigated by recommending suitable materials (such as concrete having certain qualities), cover to steel, improved corrosion resistant steel, etc., for different classes of environment. Externally applied protective barriers are indicated in certain circumstances. 5.8.6 Maintenance Periodic inspection and adequate maintenance are prerequisites for ensuring durability of structure.

These effects include the distribution of internal forces and moments as well as the calculation of stresses, strains, curvatures, rotations and displacements in static or dynamic modes. To carry out analysis, the geometry, boundary conditions and behaviour of the structure will need to be idealized both for global and local behaviour. The structure is idealised by considering it as made up of elements which can be linear, two dimensional or three dimensional. Classical methods of mechanics or modern techniques such as finite element may be used for analysis depending upon the suitability of the mathematical model to evaluate the action effects with sufficient accuracy. Since concrete is a heterogeneous material, its properties are not independent of the size of the member. These are also time dependent. For reinforced and prestressed concrete elements the structural behaviour depends on the location and amount of steel as well as the state of deformation and cracking of the element, which in turn, depends upon the level of load. In the analysis, appropriate simplified values of properties of constituent materials and properties representing composite action (e.g. bond) are made in order to represent the behaviour of these elements. The range of validity of these simplified properties and the level of accuracy in predicting the structural behaviour by analytical methods, has to be taken into account in the design process. The in-service behaviour of structural elements as well as their ultimate strengths and modes of failure are determined by the material properties, load resisting mechanism of the structural elements and, the combined effects of axial forces, bending moments, transverse shears, in-plane shears and torsions. The interdependency of various strengths of a member; such as axial, bending, shear and torsion, has been established both by theory and by experiments. However, in most cases of practical design, bending combined with axial forces and shear combined with torsion are treated separately. In this approach, the design models used in different load resisting mechanisms are not completely compatible. Design of columns, beams and slabs are typically based on this approach. For elements having complex geometry – such as shells - and for some local zones of the elements (refer Clause 7.1.2.2) design has to be based on the net effect of all forces acting together, ensuring compatibility of strains. Suitable model representing the element and appropriate method of analysis have to be used in the design process. 7.1.2 Methods of analyses 7.1.2.1 General In terms of the behaviour of the structure, the following methods of analysis may be used: (1) Linear elastic analyses for both static and dynamic response ####'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'IRC:112-2020', 'page': 41}, page_content='(2) Linear elastic analyses with limited redistribution of forces for static response (3) The ‘Strut and Tie’ method for achieving internal equilibrium within the elements in conjunction with overall elastic analysis of the structure, where stiffness of the structural elements is based on assumptions (a) or (b) as described in Clause 7.2(1). (4) Non-linear analyses, (material and/or geometric non-linearity) for both static and dynamic response. The solutions based on failure mechanisms of structure or plastic behaviour of elements shall not be used in design of bridges; except for the case of analysing response to earthquake. This shall be done only after adequate investigation of all significant modes of failure. 7.1.2.2 Local analyses In addition to global analyses of structure or its components, local analyses may be necessary, particularly where, (1) Significant and rapid changes in stresses and strains in a particular region of the structure/ component are involved (e.g. regions around openings, junctions of elements). (2) Local non-linear behaviour needs to be analysed, (e.g. locally near supports/bearings, formation of hinges). (3) Assumption of linear strain distribution is not valid. (e.g. thick sections, deep beams, corbels, anchorage zones). Where local effects are calculated separately, independent of global effects, the effects shall be combined. 7.1.3 Second order effects (1) Second order effects are the additional effects caused by structural deformations, e.g. P-∆ effect for column. (2) Second order effects shall be considered in the analysis where they are likely to affect overall stability or the attainment of the ultimate limit state at critical sections, (e.g. buckling of slender members, redistribution of forces due to creep of concrete, settlement of supports in indeterminate structure). 7.1.4 Modelling of foundations Structural elements transferring loads to the foundation strata can be treated as rigid or flexible depending on their stiffness with appropriate end conditions. Settlement effects are to be treated as independent loading conditions. Where soil-structure interaction is considered as significantly influencing the behaviour of the structure, the foundation and stratum shall be appropriately modelled (e.g. by use of appropriate springs). 7.1.5 Redistribution of moments Redistribution of moments obtained by rigorous elastic analysis may be carried out provided: (1) Reduction at one location is accompanied by increase in other location in such a way as to maintain equilibrium with applied loads. ####'),\n",

Redistribution shall not be carried out in circumstances where the rotation capacity and the section to which the redistributed moments are to be transferred, cannot be defined (e.g. in curved bridges and skew bridges with more than 15° angle of skew). 7.1.6 Non-linear analyses Non-linearity of material stress-strain relationship is taken into account for design of sections. Non-linearity arising from member’s response (e.g. due to cracking, creep etc.) is considered in calculating the deflections. Non-linearity due to formation of plastic hinges in linear members or yield lines in two dimensional elements, is not permitted except for demonstrating non-collapse condition in seismic event or impact loading. 7.1.7 Plastic analysis (1) Methods based on lower bound plastic solutions may be used provided appropriate measures are taken to ensure that ductility conditions are satisfied. (2) Elements may be idealised as statically determinate trusses consisting of straight notional struts (carrying the compressive forces in the concrete) and ties (the reinforcement). The forces in the members of the truss are established from considerations of equilibrium. Sufficient reinforcement is then provided to carry the tension in the ties and a check is performed to ensure that the compressive stresses in the struts are not excessive. Detailing requirements should then be checked, with particular regard to anchorage of all reinforcement and to local bearing stresses due to concentrated forces. (3) The location and orientation of the struts and ties should reflect approximately the distribution of internal forces resulting from an elastic analysis of the member. (4) In checking compressive stresses in the struts, consideration should be given to a possible reduction in strength due to transverse tensile stresses or cracking or the influence of shear. The average design compressive stress in the struts may be taken as v.f . In the absence cd of other data, v may be taken as 0.6, including an allowance for sustained loading. Higher values for v (even v >1) may be justified based on a triaxial state of compressive stress, provided it can be shown that the complementary transverse compression can be realised in practice.

(2) For limit state checks of deformation, stresses and crack control of beams having wide compression flanges, a constant effective width should be used over the full span while working out the sectional properties. (Refer Clause 7.6.1.2). Where greater accuracy is required variation in the effective width along the spans should be considered. (3) Modulus of elasticity and shear modulus of concrete should be appropriate for the type of action under consideration. (4) For verification of steel stresses and control of cracks in discontinuity zones, strut-and–tie model as adopted in the ULS design may be used. 7.3 Analyses for Ultimate Limit States (1) Elastic methods may be used to determine the distribution of forces and deformations throughout the structure. Stiffness constants based on the section properties as used for the analysis of the structure at the serviceability limit state, may be used in the analysis. (2) In seismic analysis, plastic methods of analysis may be used provided it can be shown that adequate ductility exists at sections/locations where successive hinges/yield lines form and these methods adequately model the global effects in combination with local plasticity. (3) The application of elastic methods of analysis for factored loads for the ultimate limit state in general, leads to safe lower bound solutions. These may be refined and made more accurate and less conservative. For suitable methods, specialist literature may be referred. (4) For longitudinal members effects due to temperature gradient may be neglected. (5) Strut-and-tie model may be used in the analysis of discontinuity regions. Struts representing compressive stress field and ties provided by reinforcement, meet at connecting nodes forming statically stable truss system. The reinforcement carries full design force of the tie over its full length and hence is required to be adequately anchored beyond the node. Adoption of model developed on the basis of stress trajectories in compression and tensile regions, established from linear elastic analysis or following direct and simple load path method, should be preferred as it will help in achieving crack control at serviceability conditions.

A wall may be considered as short where the ratio of its effective length (height) to its thickness does not exceed 12. It should otherwise be considered as slender.

The distribution of axial and horizontal forces along a wall from the loads on the superstructure, should be determined by the type and location of the supports. For walls integral with deck, the moments/forces should be determined by elastic analysis. The design moment per unit length in the direction at right angles to a wall should be not less than 0.05 n h, where n is the ultimate axial load per unit length, 0.05h is the nominal minimum eccentricity and w w h is the thickness of the wall.

(2) Differential shrinkage and creep of the component concrete members requires consideration in analysing composite members for the serviceability limit states. Differential shrinkage and creep need not be considered for the ultimate limit state. (3) In general, the analysis and design of composite concrete structures and their component members should be in accordance with the principle defined earlier except that effects of differential shrinkage and creep should be treated as a primary action. Particular attention should be given in the design of the component parts and the composite section to take into account the effect on stresses and deflections arising out of the method of construction (e.g. whether props are used or not used). (4) A check for adequacy of components/whole section should be made for each stage of construction. The relative stiffness of members should be based on the concrete or gross transformed section properties as described in Clause 7.2. If the concrete strengths of the two components of the composite member differ by more than 10N/mm2, allowance for the difference in moduli of elasticity should be made in assessing stiffness and stresses. (5) When at least one of the components is a prestressed member, the combined effect of shrinkage and creep movements of the prestressed member(s) with respect to other member(s) create time dependent variation of stresses, which may be more severe at intermediate stages leading to tensile cracking.

(3) In slender or thin sections where second order deformations are important, the increase of deflections due to creep reduces the longterm safety margin with respect to buckling instability and may lead to creep buckling. In such cases it should be treated as a primary effect. (4) Shrinkage and creep act in a complex interdependent way. The creep of concrete reduces internal stresses induced by shrinkage. Where great accuracy is not required, this effect can be directly evaluated by using reduced value of modulus of elasticity of concrete [approx. E / (1+ φ), refer Section 6] which corresponds to the stresses caused by the imposed cm strains.

Specialist literature may be referred for the same. 9.2 One-Way and Two-Way Slabs and Walls For predominantly transverse loads acting perpendicular to the plane of the slab, where primary overall in plane tensile or compressive stress fields are absent, the slabs/walls can be designed using conventional plate bending analysis and providing ultimate strength in bending and shear in one and/ or two orthogonal directions as required by such analysis. Bridge deck slabs, retaining walls resisting lateral earth pressures etc., are the typical examples. Any rational method of analysis which does not permit more than 15 percent redistribution of peak bending moments over supports can be used. The ultimate strength methods based on local yielding (e.g. yield line method) are not permitted. However, for calculating resistance to accidental impact loads (e.g. vehicular or barge impacts), use of such methods is permitted for which specialist literature may be referred. 9.3 Sub-Elements of Box Structures (1) Where box type structure resists the overall longitudinal bending, shear and torsional effects, significant in-plane longitudinal stresses are present in its sub-elements, which coexist with the local out-of-plane loading, e.g. effects due to self weight, live loads, intermediate prestressing anchorages etc. (2) Such elements can be designed primarily for in-plane effects arising from overall bending, shear and torsion in longitudinal direction. In transverse direction they are designed for out-of-plane loading effects.

The design of members requiring shear reinforcement is based on truss model. For members without shear reinforcement truss model is not applicable.

These rules take into account the important parameters mentioned in (3) & (4) below by empirical approach.

Members of thickness less than 200 mm develop higher shear strength than those having over 200 mm thickness.

For concentrated loads the steepest inclination may the taken as 26.5º (measured with respect to vertical face of beam end, generally within a distance of half the effective depth from face of support) and for loads within this distance no shear reinforcement is required.

Second order effects are defined as the additional effects of actions caused by structural deformations. Second order effects can be global, involving structure as a whole, and/or local, involving some of its members, such as columns, walls, compression flanges of beams etc. (2) Classical buckling defined as sudden failure due to instability of perfectly axially loaded members without horizontal load does not usually occur in practical reinforced/prestressed concrete members. However, long slender members at ultimate load exhibit large and disproportionate increase of deflections due to combined effect of geometric non-linearity (P-∆ effect) and non-linear structural response due to material non-linearity, progressive cracking and local plasticity. This reduces the ultimate load carrying capacity as compared to the short members of identical cross-section and steel ratio. Therefore, long members should be designed to have higher moment resisting capacity as compared to short members of identical sectional details. (3) Second order linear elastic method of analysis shall be used for calculating second order effects. Equilibrium and resistance shall be verified in the deformed state for the most unfavourable combination of actions at ultimate limit state, taking into account uncertainties in geometry and position of axial loads as additional first order effects. (4) The distinction between treatment of long column and short column for purpose of this Section 11 is based on 10 percent criteria given in (5) below. Structural behaviour shall be considered in all directions in which significant second order effects can occur. Biaxial bending shall be taken into account when necessary. (5) Second order effects may be ignored if they are less than 10 percent of the corresponding first order effects, calculated on the basis of (3) above. (6) In place of method described in (4) & (5) above, simplified criteria for identifying short and long members are given for isolated members of uniform cross-section in Clause 11.2. (7) For piers with variable sections and those acting as long composite system together with piles which are not laterally supported below pile caps, (as in case of piles in river portion between the pile cap and scour depth), full height of the substructure shall be analysed using method described in (3).

However there is a possibility that epoxy may be squeezed into adjacent ducts, when the segments are pressed together, causing blockages. To prevent this, generally a compressible foam seal is provided in the segment joint around the duct, and the excess is scraped out with plastic or rubber scrapers before the epoxy sets.

This reinforcement shall extend into the flange or web and be developed by standard hooks bent around transverse bars or equivalent.

The structure shall be designed such that deterioration over its design service life does not impair the performance of the structure below that intended, having due regard to the service environment and the anticipated level of maintenance. One of the main characteristics influencing the durability of concrete is its permeability to the ingress of water, oxygen, carbon dioxide, chloride, sulphate and other potentially deleterious substances. Degree of permeability is governed by the constituents, the mix proportions and workmanship used in making concrete. A suitably low permeability can be achieved by having adequate cement content, low water cement ratio and ensuring complete compaction of the concrete followed by adequate curing. Use of blended cements will also help to achieve low permeability. The factors influencing durability of concrete include: (1) The environment, (2) The cover to embedded steel, (3) The type and quality of constituent materials, (4) The cement content and water/cement ratio, (5) Workmanship, to obtain full compaction and efficient curing and (6) The shape and size of the member. 14.2 Common Mechanisms Leading to the Deterioration of Concrete Structures Common mechanisms of deterioration of concrete structures in service are: (1) Corrosion of reinforcement/prestressing tendons (2) Frost attack (3) Alkali-aggregate reactions (4) Attack from sulphates (5) Attack by aggressive chemicals (6) Acid attack and (7) Abrasion Description of the mechanisms is given in Annexure B-2. 14.3 Design for Durability Basic steps in designing for durability are: (1) To establish the aggressiveness of the service environment (exposure condition), with respect to the various mechanisms of deterioration.

(3) To select the appropriate materials, mix proportions, workmanship, design and detailing, including minimum cover to steel. 14.3.1 Classification of exposure conditions The general environment to which the concrete structure will be exposed during its service life is classified into four levels of severity. In doing so, it is possible that the classification relates to specific mechanisms of deterioration. The relative importance of the various mechanisms will vary from region to region in a country and no generally applicable ordering of the mechanisms can be made. However, there seems no doubt that the commonest and most serious form of degradation worldwide is corrosion of reinforcement. It can also be stated that, of the two initiating mechanisms for corrosion viz. - carbonation and chlorides; chlorides have caused the greater amount of damage by far. The classification in Table 14.1 caters essentially to corrosion of steel in concrete. Table 14.1 Classification of Service Environment <table> <tbody> <tr><td>Sl.

Greater impermeability is achieved primarily by the control of water/cement ratio and selection of the cement type. The water/cement ratio governs the strength of concrete, and strength classes are accordingly chosen, as an indirect control on these parameters. Cover (or clear cover) is the distance from the concrete surface to the surface of the nearest reinforcement, including links, stirrups and surface reinforcement. Cover is more important from the consideration of corrosion of steel in concrete. The cover should at least be equal to the depth of likely chloride ingress by diffusion over a time period equal to the design service life. Chloride diffusion coefficient in concrete depends upon the water/cement ratio and the cement type; it is lower for blended cements, and lower water/cement ratios.

In extreme environments, however, there are other measures which may have to be adopted, such as: (1) Use of galvanized reinforcement or reinforcement with fusion bonded epoxy coating. (2) Use of surface coatings to the concrete to inhibit the ingress of chlorides or carbon dioxide. Such coatings need periodic renewal. (3) Use of waterproofing membrane over the bridge deck. (4) Use of controlled permeability formwork (CPF) liners, which effectively reduce the water- cement ratio of cover concrete and reduce the chloride diffusion into the concrete.

Apart from meeting the acceptance criteria given below, concrete is liable to be rejected if it is porous or honey-combed, its placing has been interrupted without providing a proper construction joint, the reinforcement has been displaced beyond the tolerances specified, or construction tolerances have not been met. However, the hardened concrete may be accepted after carrying out suitable remedial measures. 18.6.2 Compressive strength When both the following conditions are met, the concrete shall be deemed to comply with the specified compressive strength: (a) The mean strength determined from any group of four consecutive non-overlapping samples shall exceed the specified characteristic compressive strength by 3 MPa. (b) Strength of any sample is not less than the specified characteristic compressive strength minus 3 MPa. Concrete of each grade shall be assessed separately.

It may contain chemical admixtures which modify the properties of grout in its fluid state. These recommendations cover the cement grouting of post tensioned tendons of prestressed concrete members of bridges. The purpose of grouting is to provide permanent protection to the post tensioned steel against corrosion and to develop bond between the prestressing steel and the surrounding structural concrete. The grout ensures encasement of steel in an alkaline environment for corrosion protection and by filling the duct space it prevents water collection and freezing. A critical feature of grout is that it should remain pumpable for the time required to fully inject the tendon. ####'),\n",

It should be as fresh as possible and free from any lumps. (3) Sand It is not recommended to use sand for grouting of prestressing tendons. (4) Admixtures Acceptable admixtures conforming to IS 9103 may be used if tests have shown that their use improves the properties of grout, i.e. increasing fluidity, reducing bleeding, entraining air or expanding the grout. Admixtures must not contain chlorides, nitrates, sulphides, sulphites or any other products which are likely to damage the steel or grout. When an expanding agent is used, the total unrestrained expansion should not exceed 10 percent. Aluminium powder as an expanding agent is not recommended as doubts exist about its long term effects. (5) Ready Mixed grout Alternatively, the dry materials may be batched in a factory for pre-mixed grout and mixed with the liquid materials on site as per instructions of the manufacturers. 18.8.3 Use of grout colloidal mixer It is essential that the grout is maintained in a homogenous state and of uniform consistency so that there is no separation of cement during the entire grouting process. It is, therefore, necessary that the grout be continuously mixed in a colloidal mixer with a minimum speed of 1000 RPM and travel of discharge not exceeding 15 m per second. 18.8.4 Properties of the grout Before grouting, the properties of the grout mix should be tested.

Concrete shall be placed and compacted before its initial setting so that it is amenable to compaction by vibration. The workability of concrete at the time of placement shall be adequate for the compaction equipment to be used. If there is considerable time gap between mixing and placing of concrete, as in the case of ready mixed concrete plants or off-site batching and mixing plants, concrete mix shall be designed to have appropriately higher workability at the time of discharge from the mixer, in order to compensate the loss of workability during transit. This is generally achieved by use of suitable chemical admixtures. Keeping these considerations in view, the general requirement for ready mixed concrete plants or off-site batching and mixing plants, is that concrete shall be discharged from the truck mixer within two hours of the time of loading. A longer period may be permitted if suitable retarding admixtures are used. In case of on-site mixing, fresh concrete shall preferably be placed and compacted within 30 minutes of mixing. In wall forms, drop chutes attached to hoppers at the top should preferably be used to lower concrete to the bottom of the form. As a general guidance, the permissible free fall of concrete may not exceed 1.5 m and under no circumstances; shall it be more than 2 m. When free fall of larger height is involved, self compacting concrete having adequate fluidity, cohesiveness and viscosity shall be used. Self compacting concrete completely fills every corner of the formwork by its own weight without segregation, whilst maintaining uniformity. No compaction by vibration is required. ####'),\n",

The top section of the tremie shall be a hopper large enough to hold one entire batch of the mix or the entire contents of the transporting bucket, if any. The tremie pipe shall be large enough to allow a free flow of concrete and strong enough to withstand the external pressure of the water in which it is suspended, when concrete is deposited under water. It will be necessary to raise the tremie slowly in order to cause a uniform flow of the concrete, but the tremie shall not be emptied allowing water to enter the pipe. At all times after the placing of concrete is started and until all the concrete is placed, the lower end of the tremie pipe shall be below the top surface of the plastic concrete. Concrete shall be thoroughly compacted during the operation of placing and carefully worked around the reinforcement, around embedded fixtures and into the corners of the form work. To achieve proper compaction vibrators may be used. The vibrator can be internal or external type and depending upon the shape and size of the member, both types may be used individually or together. When internal vibrators are used, they shall be inserted vertically to the full depth of the layer being placed and ordinarily shall penetrate the layer below for a few centimetres. The vibrator should be kept in place until air bubbles cease escaping from the surface and then withdrawn slowly to ensure that no hole is left in the concrete, care being taken to see that it remains in continuous operation while being withdrawn. Internal vibrators shall be inserted in an orderly manner and the distance between insertions should be about 1½ times the radius of the area visibly affected by vibration. Internal vibrators should not be used for spreading the concrete. (3) Construction Joints Concreting shall be carried out continuously up to construction joints, the position and arrangement of which shall be pre-determined by the designer. Joints should be positioned where they are readily accessible for preparation and concreting. Construction joints should be positioned to minimise the effects of the discontinuity on the durability, structural integrity and appearance of the structure. As far as possible, joints should be provided in non-aggressive zones, but if joints in aggressive zones can not be avoided, they should be sealed. Joints should be located away from regions of maximum stress caused by loading; particularly where shear and bond stresses are high. Joints should be either vertical or horizontal. For a vertical construction joint, the lifts of concrete shall finish level or at right angles to the axis of the member. Concreting shall be continued right up to the joint. Before resuming work at a construction joint when concrete has not yet fully hardened, all laitance shall be removed thoroughly. The surface should be roughened, care being taken to avoid dislodgement of coarse aggregates. Concrete may be brushed with a stiff brush soon after casting, while the concrete has only slightly stiffened. If the concrete has partially hardened, it may be treated by wire brushing or with a high pressure water jet, followed by drying with an air jet, just before the new concrete is placed. Fully hardened concrete shall be treated with mechanical hand tools or grit blasting, taking care not to split or crack the aggregates. The practice of first placing a layer of mortar or grout when concreting joints is not recommended. The old surface should be soaked with water, without leaving puddles, just before starting concreting. The new concrete shall be thoroughly compacted against it. ####'),\n",

In all cases, where construction joints are made, the joint surface shall not be contaminated with release agents, dust, or sprayed curing membrane and reinforcement shall be firmly fixed in position at the correct cover. The sequence of concreting, striking of forms and positioning of construction joints for every individual structure shall be decided, well in advance of the commencement of work. (4) Curing and Protection of Concrete The concrete shall be kept constantly wet for a minimum period of 14 (fourteen) days by ponding or covering with a layer of wet (but not dripping) sacking, canvas, hessian or similar absorbent material. Water should be applied on unformed surfaces as soon as it can be done without marring the surface and on formed surfaces immediately after the forms are stripped. High Performance Concrete containing silica fume is more cohesive than normal mixes hence, there is little or no bleeding and no bleed water to rise to the surface to offset water lost due to evaporation. Plastic shrinkage cracking is possible, if curing is not proper. Initial curing should commence soon after initial setting of concrete. Concrete should be covered with moist covers (sacking, canvas or hessian), opaque colour plastic sheets or suitable curing compound. Final moist curing should commence after final setting of concrete and continue for at least 14 days. Liquid membrane-forming curing compounds conforming to ASTM C 309, may be used in lieu of moist curing after approval. The curing efficiency shall be tested as per ASTM C 156. Such compounds shall be applied to all exposed surfaces of the concrete as soon as possible after the concrete has set, but not dried out. The membrane formed shall be stripped off afterwards. Impermeable membranes, such as sheet materials for curing concrete conforming to ASTM C 171, or polyethylene sheeting covering closely the concrete surface, may also be used to provide effective barrier against evaporation. Steam curing under atmospheric pressure is adopted to develop high early strength of concrete, so that concrete members can be removed from the formwork and handled as early as possible. This is particularly suitable for precast concrete members. Steam curing is applied in enclosures or tunnels through which concrete members are transported on a conveyor system; alternatively, portable enclosures or plastic covers are placed over precast members. Steam is supplied to the enclosures. Various elements of the steam curing cycle, e.g. the delay in commencement of heating (i.e. extending pre-steaming period), the rate of increase of temperature, the level and time of constant temperature, and the rate of decrease of temperature, shall receive careful consideration. As a general guidance, the pre-steaming period should be about one to three hours, the rate of increase or decrease of temperature should not exceed 10°C to 20°C per hour and the maximum temperature of curing can be about 70°C. The ideal steam curing cycle in a particular situation, is governed by the concrete mix proportions and type of cementitious materials and the strength required at the end of steam curing period, and shall be decided by prior trials. Steam curing of concrete shall be followed by water curing for at least seven days. After placing and during the first stages of hardening, concrete shall be protected from harmful effects of sunrays, drying winds, cold, running water, shocks, vibrations, traffic including construction traffic etc. ####'),\n",

The climatic factors affecting concrete in hot weather are high ambient temperature, reduced relative humidity, high wind velocity and combination thereof. High temperatures result in rapid hydration of cement, increased evaporation of mixing water, greater mixing water demand, rapid loss of workability and large volume changes resulting in cracks. The temperature of the concrete at the time of placement should be as low as possible, but in no case more than 35°C. For high performance concrete, the temperature at the time of placement shall not exceed 25°C. If concreting has to be done in hot weather at ambient temperatures exceeding these limits of concrete temperature, steps shall be taken to sufficiently lower the temperature of ingredients of the concrete below the ambient. The contribution of each ingredient to the temperature of concrete is a function of the temperature, specific heat and quantity of that ingredient. Aggregates and mixing water exert the most pronounced effects on the temperature of concrete. Thus, in hot weather, all available means shall be used for maintaining these materials at as low temperature as practicable, such as; • Use of chilled mixing water • Use of crushed ice or flaked as a part of mixing water. • Shading stockpiles of aggregates from direct rays of Sun. • Sprinkling stockpiles of coarse aggregate with water and keeping them moist. • Limiting temperature of cement to be preferably not in excess of 30°C at the time of use. Period between mixing of concrete and placing shall be as short as possible. Immediately after compaction and surface finish, concrete shall be protected from evaporation of moisture, without letting ingress of external water, by means of wet (not dripping) gunny bags, hessian etc. Once the concrete has attained some degree of hardening (approximately 12 hours after mixing), moist curing shall be commenced and satisfactorily continued throughout the requisite period. (2) Concreting in Cold Weather Effects of cold weather on concrete, in absence of special precautions, include; • Delayed setting and hardening, slower rate of gain of strength, • Irreparable loss of strength and durability, if freezing of concrete takes place at early ages, when it is still in plastic state. Even one cycle of freezing of concrete during the prehardening period may lower the compressive strength by 30 to 50 percent, • Disruptive effects of freezing of pore water make hardened concrete vulnerable to repeated cycles of freezing and thawing, resulting in loss of compressive strength and modulus of elasticity. • Stresses due to temperature differential within the concrete member at the time of removal of form insulations, may promote cracking. ####'),\n",

When necessary, concrete ingredients shall be heated before mixing, but cement shall not be heated artificially other than by the heat transmitted to it from other ingredients of the concrete. In general, heating of only the mixing water to about 65°C may suffice for this purpose. The temperature of the concrete shall be maintained above freezing temperature (preferably above 2°C) until it has thoroughly hardened. This may be achieved with the help of proper insulating methods before the protection is removed. Use of air-entraining admixtures conforming to IS 9103 increases the resistance of hardened concrete to freezing and thawing.

The values of actions and partial factors to be used in different combinations for verification of design by Limit State Method are given in IRC:6, Annexure B. The description of actions, their classification, nomenclature of design situations and combination for verifying different limit states as applicable to concrete bridges, are explained in this Annexure.

(iii) Snow Load Snow loads, if present, are treated in the same way as Dead Load depending on the depth of snow on superstructure. The design value of live load is modified depending on the restrictions on operation of vehicular loads which give rise to different design situations. (c) Quasi-Permanent Loads There are variable loads which act for a major part of the structure's design life. By convention, loads acting for more than 50% of the design life are called quasi- permanent. In load combinations, they are treated as variable loads with different values depending on the action effects under evaluation.

A1-3 Design Situation and Load Combination Various actions defined in Clause A1-2, act on the bridge structure at different time and in different combinations. The magnitudes of the loads also differ from time to time. Thus the loading conditions to which bridge structure is exposed are extremely large. In practice the verification that the limit states are not exceeded is carried out for a limited number of combinations, each of which represents likely condition of bridge loading during its design service life. The load combinations and the partial factors of loads to be considered in that combination are defined in IRC:6. Basically, the following four design situations are considered, depending on the duration of the load and the frequency of occurrence of load combinations. Persistent Design Situation (Basic Load Combinations) It is the design situation that is relevant during a period of the same order as the design working life of the structure. Generally it refers to conditions of normal use. This includes permanent and quasi-permanent loads as well as variable loads like live load, wind, hydraulic loads like water current buoyancy etc. ####'),\n",

A transient design situation refers to temporary conditions of the structure, of use, or exposure, such as those arising during construction or when restrictions are put on its use. Accidental Design Situation It is the design situation involving exceptional conditions of the structure or its exposure, including fire, explosion, impact or local failure. For concrete bridge structures, vehicle impact load is usually considered. The fire hazard or explosion pressures, if specified, (e.g. as in case of material storage or human occupancy below city flyovers) shall be based on the Indian Standards specifying fire resistance (as per IS 456, IS 1641 and IS 1642) and blast resistance (as per IS 4991). Seismic Design Situation It is the design situation involving exceptional conditions of the structure when subjected to a seismic event. Generally, it is not economical to design bridge structure to remain within elastic limits when subjected to ‘Design Basis Earthquake’ which is defined in IRC:SP:114. Parts of the bridge structure are permitted to suffer damage during the design event. At higher level of seismic event, the bridge elements are expected to suffer large but repairable damage without failure or collapse. Presently, IRC:SP:114 is specifying force-based design methods, which are deemed to achieve the aim of satisfactory performance. Since the structural behaviour of the bridge under seismic conditions is completely different (i.e. non- elastic response is considered) from the response to other loads (which are essentially in elastic range), the seismic situations are separately treated.

In the literature the ck inverse value of 0.85 often is used. (This factor for use with cube strength becomes 0.67). The mean values of concrete compressive strength controlled at plant and the mean value of in-situ concrete compressive strength are approximately of the same magnitude for the concrete age at 28 days. But due to other effects, such as transportation temperature changes, placing, compaction and curing, the variation of insitu concrete strength is essentially larger (coefficient of variation is about 0.23) than the variation of strength of concrete at plant (coefficient of variation is about 0.13). Therefore, the safety factor γ =1.3 is not adequate to cover this increase of variation and additional factor should be used M f s γ .To find this additional factor the in-situ strength, or a ratio f was evaluated. In-situ strength of conv ck concrete was considered as a random variable (log-normally distributed). Based on the German and Canadian data the 5 percent fractile of this ratio was found as a value of 0.90 for columns and walls and as a value of 0.83 for slabs and beams. These results corroborate the use of γ =1.15, increasing conv γ from 1.3 to 1.5 which correspond to the factor 0.85 used with the cylinder strength (or 0.67 used m with cube strength).

Relaxation characteristics are dependent on the manufacturing process. In the absence of specific data, for steels conforming to BIS codes, the following relationships may be used for calculation of relaxation loss up to 30 years. The long term loss after 50 years may be taken as three times the 1000 hour loss. Eq. A2-38 is a general equation describing relationship between relaxation loss at time t in hours (ρ) and that at 1000 hours (ρ ).

Some situations are illustrated in the following. a) Where forces, other than those produced on the completed structure, occur in any structural section during the phases of construction (e.g. deck erection by incremental launching, bridges built by balanced cantilever, change in sections during construction, change of support conditions during construction etc.). b) Where redistribution of forces due to creep, shrinkage and steel relaxation is originated by changes to the structural arrangement during the construction process (e.g. continuous bridges built span by span on false work or by cantilever). c) Where distribution of stresses due to creep, shrinkage and steel relaxation is originated by changes to structural sections during the construction process (e.g. decks consisting of precast beams and an insitu slab). d) Where the erection or construction sequence may have an influence on the stability of the structure / capacity of section during construction, the forces in the completed structure, or the geometry of the completed structure. (2) For structures in which any of the circumstances described in paragraphs (1) a) to d) apply, the serviceability limit states and ultimate limit states should be verified during various construction stages. (3) For structures in which the circumstances described in paragraphs (1) b) or c) apply, long term values of forces or stresses should be determined from an analysis of redistribution effects. Step by step or approximate methods may be used in these calculations. (4) For structures in which the circumstances described in paragraph (1) d) apply erection and casting sequences / procedures should be indicated on drawings or detailed in a construction procedure document along with assumed construction and equipment loads / configurations etc. A6-2 Actions & Effects to be considered during construction For the verifications of equilibrium and limit states during various construction stages following construction loads and erection effects shall be considered. ####'),\n",

(4) Longitudinal forces arising from construction equipment loads according to the type of the machinery. (5) Unbalanced load resulting from sequence / construction stage. (6) Horizontal wind load on structure shall be taken in accordance with the provisions of IRC:6 for construction stages. (7) Effects arising from imposed deformations shall be taken into account. These effects can be of permanent nature, depending upon the situation. In such situations the strains and stresses shall be algebraically superimposed as per applicable section at various construction stages. (8) The support restraints during all construction stages shall be ensured for stability against sliding and overturning. The situation may arise when restraint, particularly in longitudinal direction, may be absent during construction stage. Need of temporary restraint for this situation shall be either accounted for in suggested sequence & detailing or constructor shall be instructed to provide appropriate restraint.

       " Document(metadata={'source': 'IRC:112-2020', 'page': 238}, page_content='INFORMATIVE ANNEXuRE B-2 MECHANISMS OF DETERIORATION OF CONCRETE STRuCTuRES This Annexure gives description of the main deterioration mechanisms which may need to be considered in design. B2.1 Corrosion of Reinforcement/Prestressing Tendons In normal circumstances, the highly alkaline nature of concrete protects steel embedded within it. The pH value of the pore solution in concrete is generally in the region of 12 to 14. The protection is afforded by the formation of a very thin, coherent layer of iron oxide over the surface of the steel bar under such alkaline conditions. Steel protected in this way is described as being in a passive state. Steel will not generally corrode in uncontaminated concrete until the pH drops below 10. Two mechanisms, which can lead to the destruction of this passive state, are:- (1) Carbonation of Concrete This is a reaction between carbon dioxide in the atmosphere and the calcium hydroxide in the hydrated cement matrix. This process starts at the surface and with time, penetrates slowly into the concrete. The rate of penetration of carbonation into the concrete, is the highest, where the relative humidity is in the range 50 to 70 percent. It is lower at higher humidities, being effectively zero at 100 percent. The rate is also lower at lower humidities, being effectively zero at (zero) percent humidity, because carbonation can not take place without presence of water. The rate of carbonation will be lower in good quality concrete as compared to that in poor quality concerete. The rate of carbonation depends on the rate at which carbon dioxide can diffuse into the concrete. This will decrease with a decrease in the water/cement ratio. The effect of carbonation is to reduce the alkalinity of the concrete surrounding the reinforcement to a level where the natural protection is lost. (2) The presence of Chlorides in Concrete Chlorides have the capacity to destroy the passivity of steel locally, even where the alkalinity remains high, giving rise to ‘pitting corrosion’. Chlorides may get into the concrete from various sources, but the commonest are seawater in marine environments; chloride ions, if any, contained in the ingredients of concrete, particularly the mix water; and de-icing chemicals on bridge decks as used in colder climates. The rate of ingress of chloride into the concrete depends upon the amount of chloride in the service environment in contact with the concrete surface and on the quality of the concrete. Once the passivity of the steel has been destroyed, occurrence of corrosion of steel requires only two things; sufficient moisture and sufficient oxygen. It is found that these two requirements can act against each other since, if the concrete is wet, oxygen cannot penetrate and if it is dry, there is insufficient moisture for the reaction to progress. As a result, the greatest risk of corrosion is in members subjected to alternate wetting and drying. B2.2 Frost Attack If saturated concrete is subjected to frequent freezing and thawing, the expansive effects of ice formation will disrupt the concrete. The usual manifestations of frost damage are surface spalling or the formation of closely spaced surface cracks. Concrete, which is not close to being saturated, is not at risk from frost as the expansion that occurs on freezing can be accommodated in the pores not filled with water. Except in a few areas in colder regions of the country, frost attack may not pose a significant problem. ####'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'IRC:112-2020', 'page': 239}, page_content='B2.3 Alkali-aggregate Reactions There are two basic forms of reaction which occasionally occur and can damage concrete: viz. - the alkali- silica reaction and the alkali-carbonate reaction. The alkali-silica reaction is the more common in India. It is a reaction between the alkalis (sodium and potassium salts) in the cement and certain forms of glassy or crypto-crystalline silica in the aggregate, which results in the formation of a hygroscopic ‘silica gel’. This gel expands when in contact with water, resulting in the formation of cracks, which may be large (several millimeters wide are not uncommon). In relatively unstressed and unreinforced concrete, these cracks can form a random ‘map’ pattern. In other cases, the cracks will tend to form parallel to the direction of compressive stress or reinforcement. The cracks are usually not deep, only extending 50-70 mm into the section. Their effect on structural performance is not as great as might be imagined from looking at the cracks. A reduction in the compressive and tensile strengths and modulus of elasticity of the concrete occurs, but this is commonly not more than about 20-30 percent. In India, siliceous rocks like granite, granite gneiss and schist, quartzite and sandstone, containing ‘strained quartz’ have been found to be reactive. The methods of evaluation are given in IS 2386; more refined methods of detection of reactivity of aggregates are being evolved, for which, specialist literature may be consulted. B2.4 Attack from Sulphates In the presence of water, sulphate ions can react with the tricalcium aluminate component of the cement. This reaction causes expansion, leading to cracking and eventual disintegration of the concrete. The commonest source of sulphates is in the earth surrounding foundations but other sources are sometimes significant. Seawater contains significant amounts of sulphates in addition to chlorides. The severity of attack depends on the concentration of sulphate ions in the soil and subsoil water and in the environment. B2.5 Attack by Aggressive Chemicals Effluents, vapours, fumes etc. from chemical and fertilizer industries can attack concrete, leading to its disintegration. In case of a bridge structure being exposed to such harmful chemicals due to proximity to such industries, the structure should be designed for ‘extreme’ exposure condition (Table 14.1). Protective coatings may be required. For further guidance, specialist literature may be referred. B2.6 Acid Attack No concrete is acid resistant. Even mild acids can attack the calcium compounds in concrete, converting them to soluble salts, which can then leach away. The effect of acids is therefore to eat away, or render the surface of the concrete weak and permeable. Acid rain, for example, will do no more than etch the surface of the concrete over any reasonable design life. If the concrete is likely to be exposed to major amounts of acid, for example from some industrial process, the only way to avoid damage is to provide an impermeable coating to the concrete. B2.7 Abrasion Abrasion of concrete surfaces may occur due to movement of boulders, sand or gravel suspended in turbulent water, or air borne sand particles. Resistance to abrasion can be obtained by using higher strength concrete and abrasion resistant aggregates. Resistance is also markedly improved by good curing of surfaces likely to be exposed to abrasive action. ####'),\n",

Therefore, construction of good highway infrastructure along with sustainable environment is the need of the hour for economic development of the country. India is one of the fast developing economies of the World. It has a large network of roads and includes 1,32,500 km of National Highways, 1,56,694 km of State Highways and vast network of Rural and Other Roads aggregating to about 56,08,477 km. The development and requirement of roads was well emphasized by the Planning Commission of India under the 12th Five Year Plan. An amount of Rs. 9,14,536 crore was projected for the Road Sector. Annually an amount of over Rs. 1,25,000 crore is spent in development of National Highways only. For meeting the requirements of the development of road infrastructure, there is huge necessity of qualified technical manpower having expertise in various fields of Highways and Bridges viz. Planning, Design, Construction and Maintenance etc. Taking into consideration the available facilities for development of skill and expertise, there exists a gap between the requirement and availability of training institutes as well as faculties in the road sector. In fact, a number of training courses being run by different institutes, are much less than the requirements. Engineering professionals need to gain knowledge in many areas which may not be part of their engineering studies, especially Law, Financial Norms, International Funding, Policy Planning for PPP Projects and Model Contract Conditions as per International practice etc. In view of the above, this document has been prepared by the Human Resources Development Committee (G-2) concerned with Human Resource Development in the road sector. It is hoped that this document will be useful for developing course material and curriculum for various training courses and may help in bridging the gap in the training needs of road sector engineers as well as professionals. With trained professionals, there is bound to be qualitative and quantitative improvement in the delivery of road projects. The document is a follow-up of the main document on IRC:SP:92-2010 “Road Map for Human Resource Development in Highway Sector”. Other human resources working for highway sector includes workmen, operators etc. for which another document entitled IRC:127-2018 “Guidelines on Skill Development of Workmen in Road Sector” may be referred to.

It is seen that there is a visible gap between the laid down Standards and Practice followed for actual execution. There is a gap between ‘what should have been’ and ‘what has been done’. The IRC:SP:92-2010 “Road Map for Human Resource Development in Highway Sector” has delineated training needs and how the same is to be imparted within the overall ambit of organizational development. “The Road Development Plan and Vision 2021” document of Government of India has laid emphasis on the capacity building of various stakeholder organizations which include strengthening of decision support system by way of development of strong data base, specialization of professionals, re-engineering of Organizations for sound decision making, synchronization of working in the organizational set up and development of skilled man power. These objectives require that Highway Professionals are trained in such a way that their skills and knowledge synchronizes with the necessity of country at present as well as in future for developing world class highway network. As a follow up of the above objectives, these “Guidelines on Training of Highway Professionals” have been made. The identified training areas where Highway Professionals are required to be given exhaustive exposure so that they can perform their tasks as expected and in conformity with the laid down Standards and Specifications are enumerated. These training areas are supposed to acquaint Highways Professionals to the varied complexities and intricacies needed that are to be taken into consideration either while making a decision or while executing construction works of roads, bridges etc. 1.2 The objective of identifying training areas is to create conditions so that all those who are involved in road infrastructure in the country should understand as to what they are doing and what they are expected to do. These training modules would help in minimizing the gap between what one knows and what one is expected to know. 1.3 Training modules will however have to be suitably modelled depending upon the nature of the target group for Officers at three levels, i.e., (i) Junior/Entry Level, (ii) Middle Level, and (iii) Senior/Top Level. 1.4 It is hoped that the training areas prescribed will be immensely useful to all those working in the Ministries and Road Development Organizations both in the Central and State Governments as well as Private Construction Agencies, Laboratories, Consultants, Concessionaire, Environmentalists and even Public Representatives engaged in some way or the other with highway planning, development, construction and maintenance. 1.5 Approach of training in the sphere of roads & bridges including R&D shall be multi- disciplinary to know how to minimize resources, increase output & efficiency in an optimal manner.

They have background of engineering studies but that is not considered adequate for performing the assigned task in an expected manner. To some extent, guidance can be given by seniors in the Organization, but it is not adequate to perform effectively. Therefore, it is essential that practical knowledge is imparted by trainers, who have the background of practice of engineering in specific areas of highways & bridges. Professionals have to acquire the requisite skills by getting trained at different periods of their career development. 2.2 Training of engineering professionals at different levels, as a part of career growth is necessary and essential not only for the individual but for the Organization as well. It may be made mandatory for all the Organizations to impart the induction training of around 6 months at their own training facilities or central institutes like IAHE/CRRI. This training is to be imparted in such a manner that every individual gets personal attention of the trainer. Therefore, number of trainees in a class should be limited and preferably in the range of 20-25. The trainer must have background of professional work. For learning and attending required level of proficiency, trainer and trainee have to intercommunicate during training. For their guidance, different steps to be followed have been detailed below: i) Tell the trainee what to do. ii) Show the trainee what to do. iii) Make him tell what he has to do. iv) Tell the trainee how to do. v) Show the trainee how to do. vi) Show the trainee why to do. vii) The trainee should tell what he has to do. viii) The trainee should tell how he will do. ix) The trainee should tell why he has to do. x) Let trainee do the job by working on practical exercise. xi) Let trainee improve the job with the intervention and interaction with the trainer. xii) Let the trainee practice to the extent that skills are acquired, and. xiii) Let the trainer check and acknowledge that trainees have acquired the knowledge and skills. 2.3 The broad horizons for training have to extend much beyond acquiring skills and knowledge. The skills acquired are to be utilized in doing the assigned task and its management. Modern management concepts propagate individuals’ involvement beyond mind. It has to extend to heart and soul. Imparting training by covering all the aspects will raise sphere of knowledge and training will be useful not merely for performance of task but making individuals as better human beings. ####'),\n",

Therefore, one has to keep in touch with the professional knowledge by reading and referring to the latest books and journals on the subject. Besides, in order to enlarge prospect of knowledge and skills, frequent field visits are also necessary. Simultaneously, acquired knowledge and skills need to be shared. For this purpose, Highway Engineers should attend Conferences, Seminars, Workshops etc. both as delegates and presenters. With the passage of time, the trainee may have to develop himself as a trainer. It must be understood that keeping knowledge to self only deprives others. The practical knowledge if propagated and shared will benefit the public in general and highway sector in particular.

It has been successfully used in many of the developed countries. It primarily consists of interconnected air voids, which enhances surface drainage during the rainfall, thus reducing the hydroplaning potential. In addition to being a drainage and friction course layer, the OgFC has the following advantages: i. Reduction in vehicle splash (macrotexture) ii. Reduced pavement-tire noise (macrotexture) iii. Improved night time visibility. All of these advantages add up to improve road safety ultimately. iv. Improves the frictional properties of the pavement surface v. It also helps in rain harvesting when used as shoulders, a parking lot and a walkway. The details are given in annex a. Although, OGFC was widely used, there was no Indian Specification for the benefit and adoption by the Engineers. Therefore, IRC decided to prepare document on this subject and entrusted this task to Flexible Pavement, Airfield & Runways Committee (H-2) of IRC during tenure 2018-20. The initial draft was prepared by Dr. Sunil Bose and Dr. Sridhar Raju and the same was further deliberated in various meetings of (H-2).

INtRODUCtION Surface evenness of highway pavements refers to the regularity of surface finish both in longitudinal and transverse directions. Almost in all major highway works executed, control of surface evenness has been introduced as mandatory requirement. Based on 1975 report of IRC Sub-Committee of Surface Characteristics of Pavements under Convenorship of Shri Mahabir Prasad, IRC has brought out Special Publication No. 16 in 1977. The document was used widely by highway professionals as it describes existing standards and tolerances of surface evenness. These guidelines were revised in the year 2004 to incorporate improved and observed values of surface evenness and roughness of wearing surface of highway pavements due to introduction of high level of sophistication and mechanization in road construction. The second (current) revision has been done based on the feedback received from the industry as well as advancement in the technology, machinery and material. The initial draft was prepared by the subgroup comprising Shri Ashok Wasson, Shri K. Sitaramanjaneyulu, Shri M.N. Nagabhushana, Dr. Pradeep Kumar and Shri Neeraj Chadha members of Road Maintenance and Asset Management Committee. The draft was deliberated in several meetings of H-6 Committee and was finalized in its meeting held on 6th October, 2018. The revised draft was placed before the Highways Specifications and Standards Committee (HSS) in its meeting held on 23rd October, 2018. The HSS Committee approved the draft subject to the consideration of the observations of members. The Executive Committee in its meeting held on 27th October, 2018 approved the draft for placing before the Council of IRC. The Council in its 216th meeting held on 22nd November, 2018 at Nagpur (Maharashtra) considered and approved the same for printing.

An increase in road roughness results in higher road user costs and uncomfortable ride inviting criticism from the traveling public. As has been well established, the economic impact of road roughness is significant. Even a small improvement in the surface evenness or in other words the reduced roughness can yield high economic returns as the total operating cost of all vehicles outweigh the agency cost and maintenance cost for a given road. These returns are not immediately apparent to a highway agency since most of these benefits accrue to the road users. On the other hand, the consequences of neglected maintenance are immediately experienced by the users in terms of high operating cost, increased travel time and high accident rate etc. However, it needs to be borne in mind that if through assured maintenance, road roughness can be contained to lower levels, the road agencies would also benefit through deferred reconstruction investments. ####'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'IRC:SP:16-2019', 'page': 3}, page_content='The relationships between vehicle operating cost and road roughness are well established through several studies conducted both in India and abroad. These studies have quantified the impact of road geometrics and roughness on the components of operating costs such as fuel (energy efficiency), tyres, spare parts, depreciation, travel time and vehicle speed. Road roughness, therefore emerges as a key characteristic of the road condition which should be duly considered in developing maintenance standards and for fixing the level of serviceability required for the purpose of economic evaluation and energy efficiency. The PIARC Technical Committee on surface characteristics has specified frequency domains for various surface characteristics as given in table-1.1 (Descornet, 1990). The frequency range for roughness is that which induces relative motion in road vehicle suspension systems over a reasonable range of operating speeds. Road users can identify different types of roughness, such as the various forms of unwanted vehicle vibration. It is reasonable to compute more than one roughness index from a profile, if the different indices provide independent information about the state of the road. All types of roughness are not unique.

For example, vehicle manufacturers are concerned with different aspects of ride, ranging from the heaving motions that mainly involve suspension movement, to audible noise involving acoustics of the body. These are caused by widely different wavelength ranges. (The vehicle body motions are due to wavelengths of the order of 15 meters, whereas the noise involves wavelengths shorter than 1 meter.) Roughness analyses can be compared on the basis of how they process a sinusoid. Most of the analyses filter out very long wavelengths and very short wavelengths (Sayers et al, 1998). Roughness involves at least two dimensions in a complex way, as it involves variation of profile height along its length. There are two systems for measuring road roughness. A system that measures or bases the measurements on the profiles of the road is termed as profilometric systems. Systems that rely on the movement of a suspension system in response to the unevenness of the road surface travelled by a vehicle are termed as Response Type Road Roughness Measuring System (RTRRMS). ####'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'IRC:SP:16-2019', 'page': 4}, page_content='1.2 Importance of Road Roughness 1.2.1 Effect on Road Safety For many years, the ride experienced by the occupant of a vehicle has been used as a criterion of pavement roughness. A person travelling on a vehicle at a selected speed subjectively evaluates the riding experience. The vibration of the vehicle induced by road roughness affects driver performance. It has been reported by human factors researchers that continuous exposure to vibration may induce fatigue, which may in turn be a factor that contributes to accidents. It is mentioned that vehicle suspension also plays a role in the effect of roughness on safety. Frequency has a major effect on automobile and trucks that can cause safety problems. When roughness occurs at a repeated amplitude and frequency, it can have two effects. First, if the frequency is in phase with the vehicle, a rough road can seem to be smooth. Second, if the roughness is out of phase with the natural frequency, the roughness can be magnified. This phenomenon causes a problem when repeated upward forces continually reinforce already existing upward forces of the vehicle. When this occurs, the vehicle starts to move up and down with the roadway in ever increasing movements until the car or truck tyres actually leave the roadway and become airborne. The roughness of the pavement causes change in the normal forces that act at the tyre-pavement interface and affects the lateral forces needed to control a vehicle, thereby influencing the steering capabilities of the vehicle. On relatively smooth pavements, the variation in normal force is very small. However, on rough pavements, these variations can be very large and reduce significantly the lateral force available to control the vehicle. In situations where high lateral forces are necessary or where a vehicle requires a particular lateral friction level to make a manoeuvre, this loss of force could lead to loss of control of the vehicle. Roughness can cause significant loss of braking force or slip resistance on a vehicle. In addition to this, problems can arise due to variation of roughness in each of the wheel tracks of a lane. These differences of roughness in each wheel path cause differences in the braking and sliding forces that act on the vehicle. This will cause the exposure of vehicle to different levels of friction on each side, which can result in a significant safety problem. 1.2.2 Effect on Vehicle Operating Cost The Vehicle Operating Cost (VOC) components consist of fuel consumption, oil consumption, tyre wear, maintenance and repair, and depreciation. Road surface roughness is one of the factors determining Vehicle Operating Cost (VOC). Roughness affects the amount of fuel consumed in vehicles. While increasing roughness increases fuel consumption at any given speed and reduces travel speed. In Highway Development and Management Model, HDM-4, effect of International Roughness Index (IRI) on Vehicle Operating Cost (VOC) was studied, by a set of notional 1km road lengths with IRI ranging from 2 to 2.5 in increments of IRI 0.5. The result of the study is shown in Fig. 1.1. ####'),\n",

Various studies examining the roughness-speed relation have established a negative correlation between the two as roughness serves to decrease ride comfort and drivers reduce their speed accordingly. HDM models shows that at low speed, increasing speed serves to decrease distance-related fuel consumption because a greater distance is covered during each unit of time-related fuel consumption. Repair and maintenance cost also gets affected by road roughness. 1.2.3 Effect on Vehicle Riding Comfort Vehicle’s ride quality varies with travel speed, the dynamic characteristics of the vehicle, and the spectral characteristics of the roughness of the road. Assessment of ride quality and road roughness by measuring the response of a vehicle is dependent on travelling speed and dynamic characteristics of the vehicle. To obtain repeatable and reproducible measurements of ride quality, the measuring speed required to be controlled. Depending on the type of instrument and application, the measurement speed ranges from 20 to 80 km/h. 1.2.4 Effect on Vehicle Speed The effect of road roughness on traffic speed has been statistically quantified in a generalized speed prediction model under free-flow conditions. ####'),\n",

ROAD ROUGHNESS: DEFINItION, CLASSIFICAtION AND MEtHODS 2.1 Definition of Road Roughness Road roughness is the result of either the built-in-irregularities due to construction defects/ deficiencies or it may also appear on the road surface due to the consolidation or displacement of different materials placed within the pavement structure due to traffic movement. Road roughness is the deviations of the pavement surface from a true planar surface with characteristic dimensions that affect vehicle dynamics, ride quality, dynamic loads, and drainage, for example, longitudinal profile, transverse profile, and cross slope (ASTM E867). 2.2 Roughness Measurement Methods 2.2.1 Profilometric Systems Systems that measure or base their measurements on the profiles of road are, generally termed as profilometric system. When profile is measured, the continuous representation of the road can be inspected to identify local defects, or processed to yield roughness numeric adapted to specific applications. The details of some of these equipment are given in Appendix-1. 2.2.2 Response Type Road Roughness Measuring System (RTRRMS) As early as the 1920s, highway engineers installed devices in cars to record suspension stroke as a measure of roughness. These were called road meters and had several generic names, including: Response-Type Road Roughness Measuring Systems (RTRRMS), response-type systems, and road meter systems. In these systems, the vehicle is a passenger car, a van, a light truck, or a special trailer. A road meter is a transducer that accumulates suspension motions. Nearly the entire road meter designs follow the concept of the Bureau of Public Roads (BPR) Roughometer, and accumulate deflections of the vehicle suspension as it travels down the road. The BPR Roughometer is a single-wheel trailer with a one-way clutch mechanism that accumulates the suspension stroke in one direction. The roughness measure that is obtained is “inches” of accumulated suspension stroke, normalized by the distance travelled. The measure is usually reported with engineering units such as inches per mile (in/mi) or meter per kilometre (m/km), although sometimes other units are used based on the instrumentation hardware, e.g., “counts/mi.” The various equipment such as Fifth Wheel Bump Integrator or Automatic Road Unevenness Recorder (indigenously developed by CRRI, India), Car Axle Mounted Bump Integrator and Accelerometer based systems falls under this category. Refer Appendix-1 for details. 2.3 Classification of Road Roughness Measuring Systems Instruments used for the collection of roughness data are characterised into four classes as defined by Sayers et al. 2.3.1 Class 1: Precision Profilers Precision profilers are the instruments that provide the highest standard of accuracy for calculating IRI and are a series of accurately measured elevation points, closely spaced along ####'),\n",

The elevations are measured at sampling intervals not more than 250 mm with a precision of less than 0.5 mm on very smooth pavements using walking speed profilometers. However, for high speed road profilers such as Laser Profilometer (ASTM E950 Class-1 Compliance) the longitudinal sampling interval is ≤ 25 mm with a vertical measurement resolution of ≤ 0.1 mm. 2.3.2 Class 2: Other Profilometer Methods An instrument not capable of meeting the Class 1 requirements for precision, or sampling interval, may meet the criteria for Class 2. The Class 2 sampling intervals are set at a maximum of 500 mm with a precision on smooth roads of below 1 mm for using walking speed profilometers. However, for high speed road profilers the longitudinal sampling interval is > 25 mm to 150 mm with a vertical measurement resolution of > 0.1 mm to 0.2 mm. 2.3.3 Class 3: Response Type Measurements All Response Type Road Roughness Measuring System (RTRRMS) belongs to this category of roughness measurement. RTRRMSs measure the dynamic response of vehicles to the road surface by using either mechanical or accelerometer devices. The estimation of roughness index for RTRRMS is made using correlation equation after calibration with Class-1 road profiler. 2.3.4 Class 4: Subjective Ratings In subjective evaluations of roughness, the investigator physically drives along the road or makes a visual survey. ####'),\n",

ROUGHNESS MEASUREMENTS, ANALYSIS AND REPORTING 4.1 Selection of Appropriate Equipment The use of FWBI/ARUR or CAMBI or any other new technology equipment for measuring road roughness mainly depends upon the road network/area to be covered for the survey. For selection of appropriate roughness measuring device, the following points may be considered. • For roughness measurements in plain terrain areas, where the condition of roads is average to poor and average traffic speed is about 30 to 40 kmph (like on MDRs, ODRs and Village Roads), then under such conditions FWBI/ARUR, CAMBI can serve the purpose for roughness measurements, as in these areas, the standard survey speed of 32 kmph can be conveniently maintained. In such situations, the high speed and sophisticated survey equipment such as laser Profilometer may not be insisted. • On high speed road corridors (Expressways, National Highways and State Highways) where the average traffic speed is more (say >= 60 kmph), the use of slow speed equipment shall be avoided, due to safety reasons. The Laser Profilometer (LP) and Ultrasonic Sensor Based Profilometer are recommended for roughness measurements on these high-speed road corridors. • For rolling and hilly terrain areas, it is difficult to maintain the constant survey speed of 32 kmph which is essential for response type roughness measuring systems, Also, due to high gradients and frequent sharp curves in these areas, the use of FWBI/ARUR (which is a towing type device) is not recommended. In such conditions, CAMBI are preferred types of equipment and are recommended for use with a range of calibration curves at different survey speeds, say from 10 to 32 kmph. • Laser Profilometer, Ultrasonic Sensor Based Profilometer, Car Axle Mounted Bump Integrator and Accelerometer Based equipment are recommended to be used for the roads where average traffic speed is 40 to 60 kmph. Based on the above considerations, recommendations for selection of appropriate roughness measuring equipment in different operating conditions are given in Table 4.1. 4.2 Field Measurement of Roughness Measurement of roughness shall be conducted using a suitable roughness measuring equipment as per Table 4.1.

DAtA QUALItY: CALIBRAtION OF EQUIPMENt 5.1 Calibration of Road Roughness Measuring Equipment 5.1.1 Guidelines for Calibration of RTRRMS Equipment It is necessary to ensure that the roughness measurements are accurate and reliable. In response type devices such as FWBI/ARUR/CAMBI/AB etc., significant variations may often be encountered in roughness measurement. Thus, in order to ensure repeatability and reproducibility of measurement by the same machine and consistency in measurement from different machines, it is essential that the response of the device to the road surface roughness should be correct. Initial standardization and subsequent recalibration of response type devices are essential. The new measurements obtained from the response type devices must be correct to the standard roughness scale by calibration. Calibration is achieved by obtaining \"raw\" measures of Average Rectified Slope (the \"counts/ km\" or other similar number produced as output by the instrument) on special calibration sites. These sites are sections of road that have known IRI roughness values as determined with Class 1 methods. The RTRRMS is periodically run over the calibration sites 3 - 5 times at the standard speed after suitable warm-up. The \"raw\" values from the RTRRMS are plotted against the IRI values, with the RTRRMS values on the x-axis and the IRI values on the y-axis line is fitted to the data points and used to estimate IRI from RTRRMS measurements taken in the field. The accuracy of the calibrated measures can be seen approximately as the scatter of the points about the fitted line: the smaller the scatter, the better the accuracy. table 5.1 shows the requirements for RTRRMS calibration sites. A number of test sites, minimum 8 to 10 of straight sections of length 100 m to 200 m, of different roughness level covering a wide range of spectrum of surface roughness ranging from very smooth to very rough (say IRI 2.0 m/km to 12.0 m/km) are selected. Care is taken to ensure that sufficient approach length on either side is available to attain vehicle test speed before entering the starting point of the test section. The entire length of all selected sites should have uniform riding quality and free of surface defects. For better visibility, wheel paths are marked with a road marking paint along with starting and the ending point of the section for data recording. Section roughness and the corresponding reference values of each section are recorded through any of the above mentioned calibration devices for developing the calibration. At each test site, a number of runs are made till at least three sets of consistent data are obtained. Average of the three values is taken as the representative roughness values of the section. ####'),\n",

The equipment consists of a trailer towed by a vehicle. A standard pneumatic tyre wheel inflated to a tyre pressure of 2.1 kg/sqm is mounted within the trailer chassis, with a single leaf spring on either side of the wheel supporting the chassis. Two dashpots provide viscous damping between chassis and axle. The frame is provided with a counter weight at the front to make the device practically free from the effects of the vertical motion of the vehicle. A mechanical integrator makes cumulative measurements of the unidirectional vertical movement of the wheel relative to the chassis. The distance travelled is measured by a distance-measuring unit. The test is conducted at a speed of 32±1 km/hour. Roughness Index is defined as the ratio of the cumulative vertical displacement to the distance travelled and is expressed in mm/km. The equipment is driven over the road surface at a speed of 32±1 km/hour, keeping steady motion and avoiding swerving. The readings of the revolution counter and integrating counters are noted or automatically recorded in the data sheet/logger.

Fig. A.2 Sketch of Car Axle Mounted Bump Integrator The differential movement between the rear axle and the body of the vehicle due to road unevenness is measured by the upward vertical motion of a wire which is transmitted into unidirectional rotator movement of the pulley of the integrator unit. There is an arrangement in the integrating unit for converting the rotational movement into electric pulses, which is recorded by the counters/loggers. One count corresponds to 1 cm relative movement between axle and floor of the vehicle. One count in distance counter corresponds to 1 m length of distance travelled. The road roughness is affected by the vehicle speed. A bump gets magnified if the speed is not maintained. Vehicle load is another factor that influences the roughness measurement. For getting the realistic values, the constant vehicle speed must be maintained (calibration speed) or equipment shall be calibrated for multiple survey speeds. The laden weight of the vehicle is also standardized. While taking measurements, the vehicle should carry maximum three passengers.

The issue of maintaining the bridges has, therefore, become one of the most important challenges. Bridge engineers need a reliable way to assess structural integrity of bridges to maintain the continuous operation of the road network while ensuring the safety of the public. Strengthening and rehabilitation need expert knowledge and specialization. In order to guide bridge professionals, IRC first brought out IRC:SP:40 “Guidelines for Techniques for Strengthening and Rehabilitation of Bridges” in the year 1990. These guidelines covered common procedure for assessment of distress in bridges, selection of techniques and materials as also approach to remedial measures and formulation of suitable repair plans and document was widely adopted by professionals. Since then lot of advancement have taken place in testing methodology, testing equipment, repair and strengthening techniques and materials and a need was felt to revise the document to keep pace with the latest advancement and international best practice. The task of revision of IRC:SP:40 was assigned to Bridge Maintenance and Rehabilitation Committee (B-8) during the tenure 2015-17. The initial draft was prepared by the Sub-group of B-8 Committee under Chairmanship of Shri P.Y. Manjure, comprising Dr. D.K. Kanhere, Shri R.K. Jaigopal and Dr. Harshavardhan Subbarao as members. After re-constitution of B-8 Committee in 2018, the earlier subgroup was requested to carry out further work of revision and induct new Members Dr. Samir Surlaker and Dr. Sanjay Wakchaure. The document prepared by the Sub-group was deliberated in number of meetings by B-8 Committee and finally approved in its meeting held on 28th September, 2018 for placing before the Bridges, Specifications and Standards Committee (BSS) Commi ttee.

The bridge condition and its performance may be affected due to inadequate design, poor quality construction, overloading, congestion of traffic on the bridge, inadequate maintenance, atmospheric effects, lack of knowledge about long term behavior, traffic, capacity augmentation, unforeseen events like abnormal floods, earthquake etc. The consequences faced are premature bridge deterioration, loss of traffic safety or reduction of structural strength necessitating imposition of load limitations and in some cases needing replacement resulting in heavy economic as also financial loss. These could be avoided if focused attention is given to conservation of existing bridges through regular monitoring and timely repairs on the basis of systematic investigation and adequate funds are devoted by Bridge Authorities on a regular basis based on assessed requirement for this purpose. 1.3 Scope: The scope of these guidelines is as under: (i) Defining general process and approach for assessment of distresses, diagnosis of causes, proposing remedial measures and the corresponding methods and techniques for the engineering operations for different types of bridges constructed in the country. ####'),\n",

Many terms resemble one- another but are not identical. In order to have clarity, various terms are broadly defined in this guideline and are given below: i. Assessment: Analysis with the aim to ascertain the condition and the capacity of an existing structure. ii. Damage: Usually related to defects caused by external actions such as accidents, may also result from faulty design or workmanship.

Defect: Slightly worse, more categorical and specific than deficiency. v. Deficiency: Anything which found to be lacking or affecting the condition. vi. Demolition: The process of dismantling and removal of existing structure, normally with the aim of total/partial renewal or replacement. May also be used in connection with repair work, e.g. demolition of deteriorated concrete. vii. Destruction: Total damage to a structure caused by a deliberate action or by accidental or exceptional loads including earthquake. viii. Deterioration: Reduction in condition and function of structure caused by “natural” causes like climate, environment. ix. Disintegration: Severe deterioration resulting in breakup of components. x. Evaluation: Often used as a synonym for assessment, but assessment is closely related with damaged and deteriorated structures. xi. Inspection: Activity to ascertain the actual condition of the structure, including laboratory tests; but less exhaustive than investigation. xii. Investigation: More in-depth and detailed than inspections, also includes analytical studies of strength and traffic, etc. xiii. Maintenance: Activity meant either to prevent or rectify the effects of deterioration. May partly or wholly restore a specific component back to the original condition anticipated in the design. Maintenance is usually done periodically. It comprises any activity and work including inspection necessary to enable a structure to continue to fulfill the intended function or to sustain its original or required form and appearance. It excludes any work leading to improvement of the structure whether by strengthening widening or by vertical realignment of the road surface, repairs of any damage caused by exceptional causes like landslides, earthquakes, cyclones, fire, etc. The maintenance operation starts with the opening of the bridge to traffic. xiv.

The process and approach methodology for assessment and remedial measures are elaborated in this chapter. The objective is to: • Establish desired levels of maintenance service. • Form the basis for cost analysis of maintenance program. • Use men, material and money efficiently in an optimal manner. • Establish Methodology to assess performance both with and without corrective action. • Improve existing facilities wherever economically practicable through maintenance. 2.2 Factors Influencing Repair / Rehabilitation / Strengthening Strategy While deciding the approach to the problem of distressed bridges, various factors are required to be investigated. Bridges are vital link on the highways and road network and are susceptible to deterioration. Needs of society for road network and consequently the usage of bridges do change continuously. These give rise to the need for repairs, retrofitting, rehabilitation and reconstruction of existing bridges. Besides, it necessitates establishing the requirements, needs and changes the present and future bridge stock may impose on the Bridge Authority. In this regard the following factors are necessary to be considered: i. Traffic demands ii. Environmental constraints iii. Technical restrictions iv. Social-Economic factors v. Geographical conditions vi. Strategic importance 2.2.1 Traffic demands The traffic volumes and gross weight of vehicles have been observed to grow continuously. The axle loads have also had a strong upward trend during the recent decades. The tendency is to carry as much load as possible on a single vehicle in order to reduce the transportation cost. The reason for increasing axle loads is thus an economic. Authorities many a times, increases the legal axle load limits which needs to be considered for strengthening of a bridge. Another important factor to be considered in traffic loads is the size of exceptionally heavy vehicles which may cross the bridge. The growth in traffic volumes and axle weights have thus to be considered for determining the type of strengthening measures to be adopted. 2.2.2 Environmental constraints As the awareness about environmental degradation increases in the public mind, there will be more demands from them for protection against environmental damages. After the traffic, ####'),\n",

Extreme climatic conditions such as, abnormal variations in wind speed, water flow & temperature and vicinity of foul gases, harmful chemicals etc. aggravate the deterioration mechanisms. The selection of treatment depends on the type and severity of the environment. The residual service life of existing concrete structures is largely determined by its deterioration over time. The deterioration rate of concrete structures depends not only on the construction processes employed and the composition of the materials used in the construction process, but also on the current as well as past environment. Meanwhile, global warming and climate change may alter this environment in the future, especially in the long term, causing more acceleration of deterioration processes and consequently affecting the safety and serviceability of existing concrete infrastructure. 2.2.3 Technical restrictions The more complex the structure of bridges, the more difficult it is to strengthen or rehabilitate them. The higher cost related to repair and rehabilitation of such structures can sometimes make replacement more economical. The understanding of type of the bridge structure and its structural configuration is paramount in deciding the type of repair option to be implemented. 2.2.4 Socio-economic factors The bridges of regions of developed or developing socio-economic activities and public demands shall be given priority over the other areas. Past experience shows that damage to bridge components can severely disrupt traffic flow and thus negatively impacting on the economy of the affected region. The extent of these impacts will depend not only on the nature and magnitude of distress on the bridge, but also on the mode of functional impairment of the highway system as a network resulting from physical damage of its components. 2.2.5 Geographical conditions Many a times these conditions will influence the nature of rehabilitation that needs to be carried out. Treatment to be given to the bridges located in hills and landslide prone areas would differ from the measures adopted for bridges in coastal areas or bridges located in plains. 2.2.6 Strategic importance Some bridges are strategically located such as those at sensitive areas near country’s borders, those located in areas which are vulnerable to cyclones and storms etc. Remedial measures will therefore need to take into consideration the location and sensitivity of bridges. The increased importance of strengthening and rehabilitation of bridges can be characterized by: - Increased loads and traffic - Increased technical challenges in areas not yet fully envisaged, - Increased costs due to (i) limitations of the possibilities for replacement (ii) technical and practical difficulties in carrying out rehabilitation and (iii) diversion or absence of alternate route. - Increased maintenance owing to the high cost of rehabilitation of the bridge. 2.3 Decision Making Approach 2.3.1 Decision making approach for maintenance and repairs shall be preventive rather than reactive.

Bridge condition, deterioration rate, future developmental planning considerations, and remaining life of bridge shall influence policy decision. Fund availability and estimated costs of maintenance & repairs including for diversion, if any, shall also be kept under consideration. The individual decision considerations will vary in accordance with the size and importance of bridge. For rehabilitation/strengthening of major bridges, elaborate analytical techniques for evaluation of various solutions, cost as well as performance effectiveness of alternate measures/ solutions including optimization shall be done. The life cycle cost, risk minimization, safety maximization etc. could be the factors of optimization. Rehabilitation and strengthening work of minor bridges may be carried out in accordance with inter-se priority and availability of funds. In all cases, however, it should be ensured that available funds are earmarked and allocated in accordance with the Authority’s overall objectives and policies. The general policy must take into account the number of parameters already described in Para 2.2 above. In principle, the decision ranging from no action, partial/complete immediate and/or differed maintenance, repairs, rehabilitation, strengthening to replacement of bridge could be reached through a cost-benefit, NPV, LCC and similar optimization analysis. All the activities of bridge maintenance and repairs shall be institutionalized. 2.3.2 The bridges may be divided into non-structural elements with relatively short-life spans such as wearing courses, water proofing, expansion joints, paint, railings, signage, drains, appurtenances etc. and structural elements with long-life spans such as bridge decks, abutments, column/piers, foundations etc. Such division between short-life and long- life bridge elements is necessary because of the stronger economic motivation to rehabilitate and strengthen long life elements than short life elements. A division between culverts, minor bridges, major or important/state of the art bridges is also warranted. A consideration of alternate materials and techniques available, their suitability and economy are very crucial while making a decision. Traffic considerations and a division between bridges on type of roads i.e. rural roads, state highways, national highways and expressways is also necessary. The general policy for rehabilitation/strengthening of bridges must therefore be based on the following factors: Bridge Geometry: Length, Carriage Way Width, Waterway, Clearances; Environment, Load Carrying Capacity, Seismic vulnerability, Urgency of Maintenance Emergency, Future Demand, Strategic Importance, Location, Category of Road, Traffic Volume, Bridge Condition, Administrative & Political Considerations, Life of Elements. As far as possible, the decision should be based on quantitative analysis. 2.4 Technical Approach for Rehabilitation/Strengthening The best strategies can only be determined in the light of assessment of the present condition of the bridge through detailed investigation and analysis of the deterioration mechanism. Wherever possible, the root cause(s) of the deterioration should be evaluated and eliminated. Repair and strengthening operations should be mechanically and chemically compatible with the properties of the original or surrounding material and the basic structural concept. The various steps involved in working out a plan for rehabilitation/strengthening could be as below: (a) Evaluation of the Structure from Past Records, Documented Data Base and Inspection These have been given in IRC: SP-35. ####'),\n",

However, there may be hidden distresses which may surface after considerable period of time. Therefore visual inspection by an experienced engineer is a vital step in the chain of further follow-up action. A routine or principal inspection provides a detailed description of some of the damages where an assessment of the structure may become necessary. The use of various testing methods may often become necessary to ascertain the observations of the visual inspection of the structure. Testing techniques and equipment should be capable to determine the extent and type of deterioration or damage and consequences of failure to the importance of structure. To the extent possible, non-destructive tests should be used. If necessary, the results of these testes may be supplemented and/or calibrated by sampling procedures in accordance with the small step principle, that is when deficiencies are discovered from a minimum number of specimens (a small sampling ) the investigation may require a more detailed analysis. These procedures are standardized. (c) Analysis of Causes of Damages/Defects and Distresses The purpose of evaluation of a distressed structure is not only to determine the effect of damage on the structure’s life expectancy/load carrying capacity, but also, and perhaps more importantly, determinate, to the possible extent, its cause so as to intelligently determine an effective retrofit. Before repair plan is implemented, the cause of the damage has to be removed or the repair measures have to be designed to accommodate the cause and protection against it in future. Otherwise the risk of repetition of damage will continue to exist. (d) Evaluation of Results of Structural Assessment Data resulting from the investigation of a damaged structure including monitoring of its distress form the basis for the decision as to what corrective action must be undertaken. This depends on type, extent and severity of the damage. The bridges may be affected by a combination of two or more deterioration mechanisms, which is complex to analyse and needs to be dealt with care. The initial concern should be to find out whether or not there is a risk of failure to the damaged structure. If this risk is present, the first course of action must be to immediately provide an adequate auxiliary support mechanism and to reduce the loads to remove the risk. Where minor damage exists it should be investigated whether the damage is stable or will propagate with subsequent service loading. This is often a difficult and subjective assessment, made on the basis of visual examination until it can be verified with additional data and detailed calculations. The elements of time and/or the harshness of the environment becomes an important parameters when either the load carrying capacity is being diminished by deterioration (corrosion etc.) or when the load carrying capacity has to be increased due to increased traffic load or increase in legal axle load limits. Some evaluations will relate to whether or not an economically effective repair plan can limit or contain and thus can enhance the effective life of the structure. In some instances, an evaluation will be concerned with the degree of urgency required to implement a repair plan because of the advanced stage of damage. ####'),\n",

The question of urgency must also consider an estimation of remaining life expectancy. Although assumptions in a time dependent damage process are at best subjective, their evaluation will make an assessment of the degree of urgency less complex. Approximate estimations of life expectancy are valuable where damage is related to time dependent deterioration, e.g. corrosion of reinforcement. However, because of inherent uncertainties, the estimate will have to be presented in terms of upper and lower probability limits. In some cases, it may be necessary to evaluate the lord carrying capacity of the bridge. Guidelines for this evaluation have been issued separately (IRC:SP:37). De-rating and/or regulated traffic options need also to be examined in these cases. (e) Design of Repairs for Rehabilitation/Strengthening Works The most important step in the design of repairs for rehabilitation and/or strengthening work is a careful assessment of the existing structure. The purpose of this assessment is to identify all defects and damages, diagnose their causes and to evaluate the present and likely future adequacy of the structure. Generally the structural design for repairs shall conform to the relevant IRC guidelines. However, it must be recognized that the repairs for rehabilitation/ strengthening is a special type of work and many a time accurate structural analysis may not be possible for the assessment of the existing strength as well as for the repairs for rehabilitation /strengthening. At the same, the design in some cases may have to account for effects of secondary stress and composite actions. When the structural system is complex for accurate analysis, specification more conservative than IRC specification may have to be adopted. On the other hand, in certain special cases construction difficulties and thus calculated risk may have to be considered. The designer of the rehabilitation/ strengthening measures has, therefore, to be very judicious in his approach. (f) Proposals and Estimation of Costs The complexity and magnitude of the repair work will depend on whether - Only the cause of damage has to be rectified or - The structure must be restored to original condition or - The structure needs to be upgraded for its load carrying capacity and/or for its geometry. The degree of restoration will depend on whether or not the bridge is required to be restored to the original or greater load carrying capacity. If for technical and/or economic reasons, it is not feasible to achieve a complete restoration to original capacity and at the same time total replacement is not an acceptable option, a reduction of the applied live load becomes mandatory. (Ref.IRC:SP:37) The Bridge Authority in reaching a decision as to the course of action will have to evaluate not only the technically feasible options available, but also the costs of each option, time of execution, political considerations (economic impact on communities served by the facility), life expectancy associated with various options available, any historical significance of the structure, ####'),\n",

The assessment is a complex interaction between structural condition from visual inspection and construction records, information from in-situ and laboratory investigation and possible potential remedial actions. Such data can be gathered from investigation of the causes of distress and mechanism of deterioration. Assessment of existing bridge structure shall generally comprise the following activities: • Collecting historical information about performance and maintenance. • Routine inspection usually visual followed by basic testing. • Condition evaluation and planning detailed investigation if necessary. • Detailed investigation and special testing of materials. • Examination of deterioration phenomenon for assessment of durability, strength, safety and serviceability. • For reinforcement and pre-stressing steel, checking the extent and severity of corrosion and residual pre-stressing forces. 2.5.2 Various steps involved in working out a plan for maintenance, repair and rehabilitation could be as described below: (a) Preparation Proper preparation and planning are basic requirements to be met in order to carry out professional assessment of distressed bridge.

An appropriate protection against the defect cause has to be provided to avoid repetition. 2.5.3 Analysis done as referred earlier provides understanding of the causes and degree of deterioration. It is then possible to take review of the design aspects and an assessment can be proposed. The review can cover aspects such as evolution of the current service conditions, remaining load carrying capacity and deterioration progress etc. An initial concern shall be whether there is any risk of failure of the damaged structure. If it is there, the first action shall be to provide adequate support mechanism and to reduce loads. When there is minor damage, it shall be assessed whether it would aggravate due to service loads. The recalculation exercise (design review) can throw light on this aspect. The evaluation shall bring out efficacy of repair plain in as much as it can contain damage and enhance life to the bridge. In some instances, an evaluation will be concerned with the degree of urgency required to carry out repairs due to advanced stage of damage.

At the same time, the design in some cases may have to account for effects of secondary stress and composite actions. Sometimes specification more conservative than the IRC may have to be adopted when structural system is more complex. In certain cases calculated risk will have to be taken by permitting higher stresses due to constructional difficulties. The measures finally to be adopted would be governed by needs, access, traffic closure atmospheric conditions, funds etc. 2.5.5 The scheme of maintenance, repair and rehabilitation of a bridge would depend upon the following factors: • Removal of the cause of the damage. • Requirements of rehabilitation of structure to the original condition. • Requirements of up-gradation of structure to increase load carrying capacity.

The type of distress is related to the material used in design and construction of various components. 3.2 Types of Bridges Various types of road bridges in India are broadly classified on the basis of materials used and their structural form as under: 3.2.1 Type of Material: i Masonry: Stone, Brick and Cement Concrete Block ii Concrete: Plain, Reinforced and Pre-stressed iii Steel iv Composite v Timber 3.2.2 Type of Structural Form: i Arches ii Slab iii Girder/Beam and Deck Slab iv Box Cell Bridges v Steel girders with concrete deck slab vi Reinforced concrete girders and deck slab, box girders - simply supported, continuous, balanced cantilevered with suspended spans etc. vii RCC rigid frame viii Truss/Open Web Bridges ix Pre-stressed concrete girders and deck slab, box girders - simply supported, continuous, balanced cantilevered with suspended spans etc. x Cable Stayed Bridges xi Suspension Bridges etc. xii Extradosed Bridges 3.3 Distresses Normally Observed Distresses normally observed in these bridges are mentioned below: 3.3.1 Arch bridges: i Changes in profile of the arch (like flattening of arch, arch ring deformation etc.) ii Loosening of mortar: This could be considered as ageing effect. ####'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'IRC:SP:40-2019', 'page': 13}, page_content='iii Movement of the abutment or supporting pier: This is normally followed by the arch ring deformation, hog or a sag. iv Longitudinal cracks: These could be due to varying subsidence along the length of the abutment or pier. v Lateral and diagonal cracks indicate a dangerous state. vi Cracks between the arch ring, spandrel or parapet wall. vii Old cracks no longer widening and these probably occurred immediately after the bridge was built. viii A vertical crack in the return wall: This is generally seen at locations where foundations on yielding soil are stepped. ix Bulging of wall: This could be due to absence or malfunctioning of weep holes. 3.3.2 Reinforced Cement Concrete (RCC) The most common distresses in R.C.C. bridges are as follows : (a) Cracking Cracks could be of Structural and/or Non-Structural in nature. The significance of cracks depends on type of the crack, length, width & depth, location, nature (orientation), type of the structure and whether the width and length increase with time and load. These cracks can be due to several reasons like: i Plastic shrinkage and plastic settlement ii Drying shrinkage iii Early thermal movement cracks iv Reactive aggregates v Corrosion of reinforcement vi Sulphate attack & Delayed Ettringite Formation (DEF) vii Physical salt weathering viii Frost damage ix Uneven settlement x Structural deficiency xi Inadequate drainage xii Vegetation growth and xiii Constructional deficiencies etc. Shrinkage cracks occur within first few hours after initial set due to excessive bleeding and rapid early drying and result into loss of bond to bars and exposure of reinforcement. Drying shrinkage cracks occur in walls and slabs and take a few weeks to years for development due to loss of moisture. They create path of seepage and leakage. Thermal contraction cracks occur within first few weeks in thick walls and slabs due to excessive heat generation. Thermal contraction cracks could result into exposure of reinforcement, seepage and leaking. ####'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'IRC:SP:40-2019', 'page': 14}, page_content='Alkali aggregate reaction can be a cause of cracks on account of internal bursting force caused by expansive reaction of certain aggregates in high alkali content situations while frost damage can occur at any age in porous concrete. Cracks due to corrosion in reinforcement take several months or years before it leads to rapid deterioration of concrete. Corrosion induced cracks are located directly above or below the reinforcement and occur parallel to rebars. Rust stains may be visible and such cracks can indicate loss of load carrying capacity with time. Cracks due to sulphate attack may take several years to develop mostly near or below ground level on account of sulphate salts in damp ground reacting with the hydrated cement constituents. Physical salt weathering requires many months to many years for development of cracks in the inter tidal and splash zone or just near ground level in desert terrain, leading to deposition of salts and volume changes and final disintegration. Settlement cracks due to movement should be recorded and the cause of the cracks should be investigated and ascertained. Such cracks can be critical and affect the load carrying capacity of the bridge. Structural cracks may be occurred due to overstressing which in turn can be due to the overloads or due to under-designed members or due to deficiency in construction. These cracks must be evaluated depending on the location, size and apparent cause. Cracks caused by chemical reaction, alkali silica reaction can lead to serious damages to the concrete and loss of strength and capacity. (b) Delamination Delaminations are separations along a plane parallel to the surface of the concrete. These can be caused by corrosion of reinforcement. Bridge decks and corners of concrete beams, caps and columns are particularly susceptible to delamination and delaminations ultimately can cause spalling of concrete. (c) Spalling Spalling of concrete is generally recognized to be a serious defect as it can cause local weakening, expose reinforcement, impair riding quality of deck and with time can cause structural failure. Spall is a depression caused by separation and removal of surface concrete. Major causes of spalling are corrosion of the reinforcement, overstresses, etc. (d) Leaching Leaching is the accumulation of salt and lime deposits white in colour on the concrete surface. These are noticed normally on the underside of concrete decks and along cracks on vertical faces of abutment walls, wing walls etc. These indicate porous or cracked concrete. Where salts (NaCl or Sulphates) are present, the migration of moisture associated with leaching may initiate severe early deterioration. (e) Scaling Scaling is the manifestation on the surface of loss of concrete in patches. If the process continues, coarse aggregates can get exposed and become loose and disintegrated and may eventually get dislodged. Kerbs and parapet walls are particularly susceptible to scaling. ####'),\n",

But absence of rust is not necessarily indicative of no corrosion. (g) Voids/Honeycombing If tapping with a hammer or rod produces a ‘Hollow/Dead’ sound, this is indication of poor quality concrete without proper compaction or delamination. Internal voids may not be detected by hammer rap survey. If tapping produces metallic sound then the concrete is sound and well compacted. (h) Deformations These are the effects of distress which may show in the form of deflection, spalling, delaminations, scaling, cracks etc. Swelling or expansion of concrete is usually an indication of presence of reactive materials. However, localised swelling may be due to excessive compressive stress in the concrete. Twisting of substructure or superstructure units may be evidence of a settlement of foundation problem. (i) Excessive Deflections This could be due to deficiency in the structural capacity of the superstructure or due to passage of abnormal loads. Time dependent stresses also can cause such deflections if the estimated values of creep are different from the actual values. (j) Holes in Deck Slab This could be due to local weaknesses in concrete or other causes. The above mentioned distresses may also applicable to plain cement concrete bridge elements also. 3.3.3 Pre-stressed concrete Most of the forms of distresses in pre-stressed concrete are similar to those in RCC. However, certain special features are as under: (a) Cracking Cracking in pre-stressed concrete is an indication of a potentially serious problem. Horizontal cracks near the ends of pre-stressed members may indicate a deficiency of reinforcing steel, to cater for bursting stresses. Vertical cracking in the lower portion of the member not near the support could be due to serious overstressing or loss of pre-stress. Vertical crack in the bottom of the unit and at the support may be a result of restricted movement in bearings. Vertical cracks in precast members above the neutral axis of a pre-stressed member can be due to mishandling during transportation or erection but these cracks close when dead load of the deck is applied. Transverse cracks on top of deck in cantilever bridges associated with vertical deflection at cantilever tip are result of prestress loss. (b) Leaching Leaching is also evidenced in pre-stressed bridges and the associated moisture movements will aggravate any corrosion risk. Particular attention needs to be paid to the concrete or mortar adjacent to joints in pre-stressed concrete e.g. box girders. ####'),\n",

No rust stain does not necessarily mean there is no corrosion. (d) Spalling Spalling in pre-stressed concrete is a serious problem and can result in loss of pre-stress. (e) Excessive deformations In pre-stressed members, the abnormal deflections could also occur due to loss of pre-stress with time. (f) Abnormal Vibrations These could be due to slender members or combination of various reasons. (g) Environmental Effects The pre-stressing strands or wires are adversely affected due to hostile environment and presence of chlorides, sulphates and carbonates etc. in grout/concrete. Load carrying capacity of the member thereby gets reduced due to loss of pre-stress. 3.3.4 Steel For various distresses in case of steel bridges and remedial measures reference may be made to IRC:SP:74 and IRC:SP:75. 3.3.4.1 Normally observed defects in steel bridges are i Corrosion ii Excessive vibrations iii Excessive deflections and deformations like buckling, kinking, warping and waving iv Fractures v Distresses in connections, and vi Fatigue cracking 3.3.4.2 Deterioration of steel The causes of deterioration of steel are: i Deterioration of the protective paint systems: may be due to accumulation of debris, accumulation of moisture, flaking of the paint, cracks in the paint ii Corrosion iii Rust: It may be Light rust formation & pitting the paint surface, Moderate rust formation with scales or flakes; and Severe rust formation & stratified rust or rust scale with pitting of the metal surface. iv Electrolytic action - Other metals that are in contact with steel may cause corrosion similar to rust. ####'),\n",

However it is usually observed that the distresses like cracks are more common at the interface between two materials due to horizontal shear, the shear connectors being either absent or being of insufficient capacity. 3.3.6 Timber bridges Some of the normally observed distresses are: i. Cracking and splitting of members due to overload, ageing or under-designing of members. ii. Abnormal deflections due to overloads or under designing or imperfect joints. iii. Infestations decay etc., due to environmental aggressiveness. iv.

It is envisaged that concrete will continue to be the primary construction material for bridges in coming years also. Considerable investigations and research have been done in respect of concrete and more research is in progress. Based on research and field experience procedure for testing and diagnosis of concrete bridges has been updated and brought out in this chapter. 4.2 Investigation A desk study for review of available drawings to identify vulnerable areas and components should be done before investigation. In case drawings are not available, concerned engineer should provide basic details. Identification of human and technical resources for investigation shall be done by an expert engineer. Investigation is to be carried out at three stages – namely a visual survey to assess the overall integrity of the bridge. A general survey including a limited amount of physical testing to the extent possible and finally a detailed investigation to determine the extent and severity of deterioration is to be carried out. 4.3 Visual Inspections Visual inspection by an experienced bridge engineer who has previously handled similar situations is the most important basic and essential step. Generally the occurrence of distress becomes apparent much before the load carrying capacity is adversely affected. However, it is likely that in some pre-stressed concrete structures, manifestation of distress may not be very distinct and clear. Warning signals of distresses are indicated by spalling, rust stains, cracks, excessive deflections, abnormal vibrations, loss of camber, malfunctioning of bearings & joints, leakages and deformation of structural elements etc. During inspection, these signs should be verified and noted. Arrangement of proper access to various components of the bridge is a pre-requisite prior to embarking on this task to ensure thorough inspection. 4.4 Testing Methods A variety of semi-destructive and non-destructive testing methods are available for investigating different properties of concrete in addition to vital visual inspection described earlier. Tests are aimed at assessment of strength and other properties and to locate and obtain comparative results indicating weaker regions, cracks, delaminations and areas of lower integrity than the rest. It is essential to emphasize here, that it is not necessary to carry out all the tests in each case except the most relevant one. It is necessary to arrive at essential tests considering visual inspection report. As a matter of fact, in certain cases, engineering judgment would help to take decisions faster. Details of various tests and their suitability and availability are given in the Table 4.1. Different tests related to corrosion in RCC and PSC structure are mentioned under Note below the Table 4.1. ####'),\n",

Prior estimation of various design parameters with high and low assumptions as regards to the assessment of bridge condition is needed. This will facilitate the choice of best suited technology and fixing operating limits during the tests. The various non-destructive and other evaluation methods have several limitations as there are various parameters influencing each test and many a time combination of different methods have to be used during investigations.

But it is often difficult to analyse the effects or defects or deterioration on the overall performance of the bridge or on the stresses in individual components. A full scale load test can, therefore, be useful. Load tests can be expensive and on larger bridges they require considerable planning, involve many people and demand the use of sophisticated equipment. Testing in remote locations can present additional difficulties. Particular care is needed for bridges with brittle failure modes. However, load testing can often be justified where the effect of defects and/ or deterioration on load capacity cannot be determined by analysis alone. However, a decision to carry out full scale load testing should not be undertaken without a serious thought. The procedure and acceptance criteria for load rating of bridges is given in IRC:SP:37 and for load testing IRC:SP:51. The instrumentation and equipment needed for load testing is also elaborated in the above mentioned guidelines. The following may also be considered with regard to load testing of bridges: ####'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'IRC:SP:40-2019', 'page': 26}, page_content='(a) Bridge testing is both an art and a science. In its simplest form, load testing involves measuring the response of the bridge to a known applied load. Considerable experience is required to know where to locate gauges and to determine load increments and the maximum load to be applied to prevent damage to the bridges. The load is applied, usually by vehicles although occasionally by dead load or through cables, to induce maximum effects. Where measurement of stress at given location under known load is all that is required, data processing may not be a major consideration. In other cases, the amount of data recorded is often extensive such that automatic data recording and analysis is highly desirable. It is also preferable that this be done on site as the test progresses so that deviations from anticipated behavior are known and the necessary changes in procedure or equipment can be made. Because concrete properties are required to define stress values (from strain measurements), samples must be taken from the structure. (b) Jacks, duly calibrated, can be used to measure the reactions at the supports of the structure. This may be required for such purpose as assessing the impact of thermal gradients, or the re-distribution of stresses due to creep, settlement or faulty construction. In addition to the requirement for suitable jacking points the deck joints must be removed together with any other feature which might interfere with the free movement of the jack. Alternatively, for better accuracy and to obtain direct reading, appropriate and duly calibrated load cells, may be used to give support reactions within a range of 0.3 to 1.0 %. __________ ####'),\n",

IRC:89 shall be used for more guidance. (1) Erosion Problems Gabions, mattresses, rip-rap, boulders, stone/concrete block pitching, geo-textiles bags/tubes, grouting etc, can be used for erosion of bed as well as banks. For the details of materials, design etc. Handbook for flood protection, anti erosion and river training by Central Water Commission may be referred. (2) Protection against Scour Excessive scour is one of the major factors that may cause or lead to structural failure or distress of the foundation. The degree of damage depends on factors such as stream bed material, intensity of discharge, silt charge, obliquity of stream flow and shape of the structure. For deciding the extent and type of repair for scour, ascertaining the causative factors, such as change in the alignment of the stream, an inadequate waterway or the presence of debris, is of great help. Providing the most effective solution to a scour is challenging and may require model studies. Spur dykes, jetties, deflectors and other measures may be constructed to deviate water away from a fill, bridge pier, or abutment. Only correctly designed and constructed training works are helpful in controlling scour which may vary from simple solution such as replacement of displaced material to complicated solutions like jacketing, sheet piling, strengthening the footing ####'),\n",

Piers and abutments may be protected or repaired by placing sheet piling Sheet piling should be driven to a depth where non-erodible soil conditions or rock exist. The overhead clearance required or under substructures may be a major disadvantage in deciding sheet piling. If supporting material has been removed from under a large area of the footing, consideration should be given to redesigning the foundation, including filling the void with concrete. In some cases, the footing may be extended by using sheet piling as forms for the extension and as stay in-place protection against the scour. In case of exposed supporting piles, particularly if they are short it may be necessary to drive supplemental piles that are as a part of the extended foundation. Around piers it is common to provide what is known as ‘garlanding technique’. In this, very heavy concrete blocks or stones of designed size and weight are placed around the pier foundations below the bed level by excavation. This technique can also be used during floods by dropping heavy stones or blocks from a distance on upstream side depending upon the velocity of water and weight of stones after trials. This would save excavation and special arrangements in Perennial River. (3) Foundation on soft rock subject to erosion can be protected by reinforced concrete curtain walls enclosing the footing. (4) The bearing capacity of the soil can be increased by injecting cement or chemical grout such that grout pressure does not exceed the overburden pressures. (5) Rock or ground anchors are often used for erosion around abutments taking into account various factors likely to affect the bearing capacity and durability of the anchoring system. (6) Extension of Existing Foundations This would be necessary while widening an existing bridge. The foundation, substructure or superstructure of widened portion may be of same or the different material and structural configuration. (7) Liquefaction of Foundation Soil Some foundation failures could be the result of excessive soil movements especially due to liquefaction during earthquakes. There are two approaches to retrofitting that will mitigate these types of failures. This may be mitigate either by replacement/stabilization of soil or strengthening of the structure to withstand excessive relative displacements. Possible methods for soil stabilization include: Lowering of ground water table, Consolidation of soil by vibro-floatation or sand compaction; Placement of permeable over-burden; grouting or chemical injection. At a site subjected to excessive liquefaction, methods to strengthening of the structure as well as stabilization of the soil may be necessary. (8) Underwater Work While dealing with underwater work, it will be relevant to refer to underwater inspection also. Inspection of underwater portions of the structures is very difficult because of the harsher environment, poor visibility, deposition of marine organisms etc. To do an effective underwater ####'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'IRC:SP:40-2019', 'page': 34}, page_content='inspection, it is necessary to deploy properly trained and equipped personnel. The quality of underwater inspection must be same as that of above water. Cleaning the marine growth from underwater portions of a bridge is always necessary. Visual inspection is a primary work of detecting underwater problems. In turbid waters, the inspector should use tactile examination to detect flaws, damage or deterioration. In some cases sophisticated techniques, ultra-sonic thickness gauges, computerized tomography or TV monitors may be used. After the initial identification of the damage, it may be necessary either to expose the member by means of a cofferdam and dewatering or by providing a small air-lock as described later for the purpose of detailed examination and carrying out repairs. Underwater photographic techniques are also available wherein damages are detected by divers who can take photos, videos or scan the various components of affected areas, which can be displayed on a screen/monitor on the bridge deck. Acoustic microscopic measurements or tomography can be used for identification of defects of underwater bridge components. But, Sonar procedures for mapping scour are useful. For underwater repairs the surfaces of the pile or well or pier have to be cleaned of the dirt and other foreign materials and after removing the cracked and unsound concrete, the surface shall be ready for receiving new concrete. It is often useful to provide temporary cofferdam. Suitable priming coat by materials like moisture compatible may be helpful to ensure proper bonding. Placing of concrete under water can be carried out with the help of conventional underwater bucket/tremie concrete, pre-packed concrete, bagged concrete or pumped concrete depending on the site conditions. The piles or wells which are substantially deteriorated by corrosion or other defects can be provided with integral jackets which may or may not be reinforced depending on the thickness of the jacket. Joint of the jacket at its ends have to be properly detailed out and treated with suitable adhesive. Grouting with quick setting cement or epoxy can also be carried out where necessary. Methods used to perform underwater sealing and repairing of cracks by suitable grout injections are similar to methods used above water, except that for underwater use, grout must be water insensitive. Before application of surface sealer, cleaning is necessary. If oil or other contaminants are present in the cracks, and the sealer is used for restoring the strength of the cracked concrete pier or pile instead of simply blocking the free entry of water in the crack, bonding will be improved by mixing detergents or special chemicals with a water jet to clean the crack interiors. After all cracks are prepared and sealed and the nipples positioned, the low viscosity adhesive is injected under pressure into the cracked area. Various methods used to prevent the corrosion of steel piling in sea water, include application of protective coatings, encasement of steel in concrete or a combination of these procedures. Cathodic protection can also be used. 5.3 Repairs to Masonry Structures Existing masonry bridges are to be considered as historical landmarks and need preservation. Strengthening and widening maintaining the same appearance. Widening is usually not possible but strengthening can often be done. Strengthening of Masonry Bridges ensuring pleasant appearance is a delicate task and expertise is required. Some of the defects and remedial measures for stone or brick masonry arch bridges are given below. ####'),\n",

Generally, low pressure grouting is done to strengthen the old mortar. A suitable pre-bagged grouting material similar in mechanical properties to the existing jointing material should be used for effective bond. (ii) Longitudinal Cracks along the Direction of Traffic: it is possible to rake mortar joints and refill with a polymer modified mortar similar in mechanical properties to the existing jointing material. Fine material grouting in the form of injection can be adopted for remedial measures. Grouting can also be done by using suitable polymer modified grouts depending upon size of cracks and mechanical properties expected. However it must be mentioned that the depth of penetration of grout is important, as usually it is not possible, to suspend traffic. If possible, the portion of earth fill could be removed to ensure that penetration is limited to masonry only. This can be achieved by controlled grouting and proper spacing of inlet for grouting. Fiber Reinforced Cementitious Matrix (FRCM) can also be used to strengthen the bridge by means of wrapping. (iii) Transverse Cracks: Injection of, polymer or suitable grout as per size of cracks will provide a good bond between stones and brick masonry. (iv) Strengthening of Arch Rings: The arch ring can be strengthened either by adding material to the intrados or to the extrados. The arch can be strengthened by constructing an RCC Arch below the masonry arch with suitable dowel connection. The intrados of the masonry arch can be used as formwork. For supporting the RCC Arch, necessary jacket can be provided to pier and foundation with suitable anchorage with old structure. In order to arrest lateral movement of arch, suitable reinforcement can be placed connecting rings of both sides of arch and anchored at ends. (v) Strengthening of Arch by helical reinforcement: Using helical stainless steel ties and bars, which have good axial strength combined with sufficient lateral flexibility which allows the structure to move naturally and therefore minimize additional stresses. Details of helical reinforcement and its embedment at various locations of arch as given in Fig. 5.1 below: Fig. 5.1(a) A view of Heical Reinforcement Fig. No. 5.1 (b) A Helical Reinforcement Provided in one of the Arch Bridges ####'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'IRC:SP:40-2019', 'page': 36}, page_content='Fig. No. 5.1 (c) Provision of Helical Reinforcement for Arch The helical reinforcement can be used for minimizing movement in spandrel walls, separation of brick arch rings, cracking in arch barrel, delaminated masonry, cracked piers, wing walls and abutments, cracked and unstable parapet walls. A more effective, but at times an expensive, treatment is to remove the fill and cast the extra required thickness on the extrados of the arch. Usually, a full ring is cast but occasionally only the end quarters are strengthened to act as cantilevers and reduce the effective span of the arch. Normal concrete placing techniques are satisfactory. Replacement backfill may be with normal or lightweight concrete. The latter will reduce dead load on the foundations but may also reduce the factor of safety for stability of the substructure. Another expedient which is satisfactory where the increase in load carrying capacity is relatively small, especially for small span bridges, is to cast slab at road level to act as an auxiliary deck. Strengthening of soffit of arch including arch elements such as spandrels can be done by the use of tie bar and jacketing with ultra-high performance fiber reinforced concrete or CFRP. The fiber reinforced cementitious matrix is similar to carbon fiber fabrics and are embedded in a ductile cementitious matrix instead of epoxy, which has extremely high compressive strength. This material has many advantages over CFRP and they are: • FRCM allows the application on wet surface, provides a high thermal resistance and similar fire resistance as concrete. Helps maintain ductility of structures strengthened. • Suitable for enhancing flexural, shear and compressive strength of structural elements. • Low thickness with a minimum increase of the cross-section on the structure. Keeps the geometry and appearance of the strengthened elements. • Long lasting, it is highly resistant to abrasion, not affected by corrosion process, withstands marine environments and freeze-thaw cycles. ####'),\n",

Very easy and quick to use, saving labour costs and reducing use of auxiliary tools. 5.4 Repairs to Concrete Structures The majority of bridge structures will be either concrete, RCC or Pre-stressed Concrete, techniques for repairs to concrete structures are described in a separate Chapter 6. 5.5 Repairs to Composite Structures Comparatively very few defects have been reported with well-designed and fabricated shear connectors in composite structures. Problems with concrete decks in composite structures are essentially of the same kind and order of magnitude as those found in concrete decks in regular structure. It is likely that some early structures are seriously inadequate with regard to shear connectors for the heavier design loads now specified. The same can be also said for the main load carrying structural steel components. Difficulties may be encountered with deck replacement or even major deck rehabilitation and strengthening operations in those composite bridges in which residual relieving stresses have been introduced by sophisticated erection procedures combined with an elaborated casting sequences for the bridge deck. Such cases would be very few in this country. Prior to concreting deck slab, use of very high pressure water jetting say usually beyond 70 MPa, to remove the concrete around shear connectors is considered preferable to jack hammers so as to minimize damage. 5.6 Repairs to Steel Structures 5.6.1 Deck Replacement Many of the old bridges, usually truss or arch bridges, having either warped steel plates with a bituminous surfacing or a concrete deck often get corroded due to insufficient waterproofing of steel plates. Bridge decks can be replaced by new concrete decks or by new orthotropic steel decks, specially for reduction in weight or for widening. The use of light weight concrete is often preferred for reducing the loads. Bolting is the preferred method of connecting the new deck system to existing structural members. Steel grid decking can either be left open or filled with concrete. 5.6.2 Strengthening of Structural Members Strengthening usually involves more conventional techniques such as replacement of members, diaphragms or plate bonding either with bolts or welds. Strengthening of plate girders can be done by adding stiffness to flanges, webs and diaphragms or by external pre-stressing. 5.6.3 Repair of Cracks Cracks can be due to any one or a combination of the following reasons: i) High stress concentrations joints/location due to in appropriate detailing or loose connections may be avoided by champher ii) Increased traffic loading ####'),\n",

However this process is expensive. 5.6.6 Use of Steel Arch superposition Scheme This can be used to strengthen old truss bridges. The strengthening scheme consists of superimposed arches, hangars and additional floor beams. The concept of combining a truss with an arch is by no means a new system. The idea is that a light arch can carry a significant load if properly supported laterally. In this case, the truss with its cross-beams provided the lateral support while the arch in combination with the hangars and additional floor beams provides the increased load carrying capacity. Additional floor beams and hangars are used for two reasons: i) The more uniform the load distribution, the more efficient the arch will be in carrying the load. ii) The floor systems of many old truss bridges get deteriorated and are sometimes under-designed and unreliable. ####'),\n",

The arch superposition scheme can be considered as an overall strengthening measure. The load carrying capacity of the entire structure is upgraded, thus allowing the live load to be increased. There is no need for temporary shoring or jacking for the installations of the super positioned elements. Increase in dead load can be expected to be in order of approximately 15 % to 20 % percent.

The latter can be seriously compromised if there is a poor adhesion between the fresh concrete of the repair and the existing concrete surface. Therefore, it is important that the contact surface to be repaired is in hard and sound condition. In general, all foreign / loose / soft /damaged and fractured concrete materials are removed that might affect or other impair the repair and must be properly treated. The methods for preparation of surfaces can be categorised as below: • Mechanical methods • Hydraulic methods • Thermal methods and • Chemical methods The choice of a suitable method depends on the type, location, extent and severity of distress as well as the thickness of the layer of the damage in the structure which has to be treated. The thermal and chemical methods are rarely used and are restricted to special circumstances and hence have not been described here. i. Mechanical Methods The Mechanical equipment is preferable, as it is more intensive, reliable and speedy. While choosing and applying mechanical methods, it must be ensured that the sound concrete and the reinforcement are not damaged. If necessary, trials should be carried out. The commonly used mechanical methods are jack hammers, milling, chipping, sand blasting, steam blasting and compressed air cleaning. During a mechanical surface treatment of concrete, dust will always occur, and therefore the surface must be free of dust before start of the repair work. ii. Hydraulic Methods Hydraulic methods such as use of water jetting or blasting can also be used and are considered preferable to jack hammers for damage prevention. A water jet with 10 to 40 MPa pressure at the jet shall remove loose particles, scaled concrete or vegetation coatings. This method is not applicable for roughening of solid concrete surface.

In hydro-jet method, with the jet pressure at 140 – 240 MPa a deep penetration into the concrete or even cutting grooves is possible. This method is essentially free of vibrations, but there will be deep penetration of moisture into the concrete and needs careful handling or else could be hazardous. 6.1.2 Bonding agents (a) General Bonding agents are recommended to improve the bond between old concrete and the repair concrete. There are two types of bonding mechanisms as below: - Physical bond through adhesion and cohesion; and - Chemical adhesion through reaction with the surface In most cases, both types of bonding exist in combination. There are various types of bonding agents. (b) Cement Paste/Slurry The cement paste with a low water/cement ratio is used as bonding agent which is applied by brush on to the surface to be repaired. (c) Cement Mortar A cement mortar consisting of equal parts of cement and sand along with water of requisite viscosity may be used as bonding agent. It can, also be used for the repair itself wherein the coarse aggregate has been absent. (d) Polymer Modified Cement Paste/Mortar The polymer mixed into the cement paste or cement mortar via the mixing water can also be used as bonding agent for greater adhesion. The plasticizers with certain portions of solid substances such as Styrene Butadiene Rubber (SBR) polymer or acrylic resin may be added to the mix. The emulsions may also be used. The bonding effect depends on the type of polymer/additive being used. These additives are used to improve the workability and water retention capacity in addition to improve the bond strength. (e) Resins There are two basic types of bonding agents made of resins namely; emulsified agents and normal agents. The first case consists of a combination of a water emulsified epoxy, resin, a polyamide resin hardener and a filling material. The epoxy/resin and the hardener are initially mixed together before placement. If required, the mixture may be diluted with water. In the two component resin bonding agents, a pure resin-hardener-mixture is used, with or without fillers. Filler may be added in a suitable design ratio. Filling materials mixed with resins are used for following reasons. - Filling materials prevent a deep penetration of resin into the old concrete. - Filling materials prevent a penetration of resin into the new concrete - Filling materials are less expensive than epoxy/resins and - Resins with fillers can be placed in thicker layers. ####'),\n",

Therefore, the durability of a structural element cannot be assessed only from the physical appearance of its surface. The composition of the external surface layers is comparatively different from the interior of the structural element, in particular the cement content is more towards the surface. The concrete surface, for desired aesthetic appearance, should not affect the durability of the structural element. If the concrete is to be protected from the external influences and enhancement of an already existing weathering is of concern, measures need to be taken to either minimize or stop this process. The following measures in the order of increasing surface protection can be used: - Hydrophobation - Impregnation - Painting - Sealers and - Coatings There is a difference in how protection is achieved from impregnation systems and sealers and/ or coating systems. Protection is achieved in the impregnation system through a prevention of a capillary absorption of water by the concrete. Depending on the material used, this effect will be achieved by a hydrophobation of the pores at the surfaces or by a narrowing of the capillary ducts, which result from a film formation on these surfaces. Sealers or coatings lead to a closed thin film on the surface. 6.1.3.2 Materials and techniques of application (a) The efficiency of an impregnation basically depends on the preparation of the surface and on the required depth of impregnation. Requirements for impregnation material are small molecular size and low viscosity. The absorption is accomplished via the capillary voids of the concrete. The proportion of capillary voids increases with increasing water/cement ratio. The impregnation liquid must be placed on the concrete surface in an amount to fill the voids. The application may be accomplished by means of a brush, lambskin roller or by spraying. Depending on the absorptive capacity of the surface, several repetitions may be necessary. For solvent containing impregnation systems, the concentration of the solution during the first application may require thinning to achieve a deeper penetration. Penetration depth is especially important where traffic wear is expected. Therefore, impregnation protection systems are only suitable where the concrete surface will not be removed by abrasion, damaged or locally affected by the formation of cracks. While impregnation with resins may be successfully used on horizontal surfaces, hydrophobizing impregnations are not suitable for horizontal surfaces where water will stay on the surface. Therefore, the primary field of application of hydrophobizing impregnations is on vertical or sloped surfaces, where the water can flow off easily. (b) Sealers: Is a treatment to concrete to reduce the surface porosity and strengthen the surface. These are also often referred to as surface primers or sealers. • The pores and capillaries are partially or totally filled. ####'),\n",

(c) Coatings: Is a treatment to produce a continuous protective layer on the surface of the concrete. Thickness is typically of 0.1 to 5.0 mm. Particular applications may require higher thickness than 5 mm. The materials for coatings to be used shall be organic / inorganic polymers such as Acrylics, Epoxy, PU, PMMA or Silicone Resins (individual or in combination) with or without fillers. These coatings may also be referred to in common terminology such as but not limited to: Anti-Carbonation Coatings, Poly-Urethane (PU) Coatings, Bridge Deck Waterproofing Systems, Coal-Tar Epoxy Systems, Epoxy or PU Coatings. Compared to sealers, coatings have an increased resistance to the diffusion of internal moisture and provide an additional protection against mechanical influence. A differentiation should be made between thin and thick coatings. Thin coatings, will follow the contour of any unevenness of the surface while a thick coating will smooth out any unevenness of the surface. Coatings should also have the capability to bridge cracks. This requires a high elasticity of the coating material. Some systems, however, are not sufficiently resistant to mechanical loads and need an additional protective layer. They may also be used as a membrane underneath asphalt overlays. A special mention needs to be made in terms of protective coatings. Piers above the tidal zone and the superstructures are best coated with Anti-Carbonation Acrylic, Elastic-Elastomeric coating. The system comprises water based (solvent free), conforming to code and specification, acrylic polymer modified with selected mineral fillers, applied over the prepared surface to form an anticarbonation elastic elastomeric protective membrane. The coating should have anti carbonation and water vapor diffusion property and should be resistant to action of UV radiation. It should be waterproof and capable of bridging crazings and cracks. The coating protects exposed faces of the superstructure and the substructure of concrete bridges from the aggressive action of industrially polluted and marine/saline environment. The specifications of the coating can be taken from IRC:SP:80 or from MORTH - Specifications for Road & Bridge Works. Another specific coating system is one for protection of Bridge Decks. This system is also often referred to as Bridge Deck Waterproofing. These coatings can be based on either Epoxy, Polyurethane or Polyurea based Systems. These materials should have adequate crack bridging ability to withstand thermal stresses. The coating systems shall have requisite certifications along with national and international reference with proven for performance. 6.1.3.3 Replacement of substantial depth of concrete section If the deterioration has reached a level where a shallow surface repair may not be sufficient, a replacement of the affected concrete section should be considered. The choice of the repair material depends on volume to be replaced, the depth of the repair, the loading effects to be expected and the site conditions. In all cases, an appropriate pre-treatment of surface is required. ####'),\n",

The following materials for replacement of a substantial depth loss of concrete surface should be considered: - Polymer modified, cement-bond systems; and - Cement mortar or concrete (normally concrete similar to original mix but with reduced water cement ratio or higher grade of concrete is best). - Shotcrete (gunite): Shotcrete is suitable for the repair of surface damages, concrete replacement as well as for the strengthening of structural elements. Pre-treatment of the surface is of prime importance while using shotcrete. Sand blasting has proved to be an efficient surface treatment procedure. However, environmental protection regulations should be verified before use. The surface should be sufficiently pre-moistened. No bonding agent is necessary because at the interface surface, mortar enrichment occurs as a result of aggregate rebound. Shotcreting in multiple layers requires that the preceding layer achieves a sufficient degree of hardness. Minimum reinforcement may be required for thicknesses larger than 50 mm. The reinforcement should be fixed in position in such a manner that it remains stiff/firm and keeps its position during shotcreting operations and to ensure adequate cover in the finished works. Curing may be accomplished by an evaporation protection, e.g. plastic sheet. If a freeze-thaw/ salt resistant concrete is required, air entrainment admixtures may have to be added to the concrete mix. Also, surface protection measures may become necessary. There are two basis shotcrete processes: i) A dry mix process where most of the mixing water is added at the nozzle and the cement-sand mixture is carried by compressed air through the delivery hose to a special nozzle, and ii) A wet mix process where all of the ingredients, including water, are mixed before entering the delivery hose. Shotcrete suitable for normal construction requirements can be produced by either process. However, differences in cost of equipment, maintenance and operational features may make one or the other more feasible for a particular application. Properly applied shotcrete is a structurally adequate and durable material and is capable of excellent bond with concrete, masonry, steel and some other materials. However, these favorable properties are contingent on proper planning, supervision, skill and continuous attention by the application crew. In general, the in-place physical properties of sound shotcrete are comparable to those of conventional mortar or concrete having the same composition. Special variants of shotcretes result from the addition of polymers, fibers or of synthetic resins. Steel, glass (boron-silicate-glass) and plastics are used for the fibers. The ratio of the fiber to cement will be larger in the initial mixture than in the rebound material. The last layer must not contain steel fibers. In the case of steel fibers, corrosion protections must be considered, unless the fibers are protected from corrosion. ####'),\n",

The removal of damaged concrete is usually done with electrically powered or compressed air ensuring that the reinforcement is not damaged. Flat chisel is normally used to minimize micro crack formation which can cause repair failures. For a complete removal of a structural element larger equipment such as sawing, cracking, thermal lancing and blasting may also be adopted. Special care needs to be taken while removing concrete in pre-stressed concrete structures. Hydro demolition is the latest method where water is sprayed on to the concrete in thin jets at a very high pressure and enables removing of concrete in a more efficient and precise manner without damaging reinforcement and in a better working environment. The replacement of concrete in larger continuous areas should proceed in the same manner as during the construction of the concrete structure. However, certain features resulting from the combination of old and new concrete should be considered. Placing concrete in the area to be repaired should be accomplished in such a manner as not to impede concrete flow and to avoid the entrapment of air, thus avoiding voids in the concrete. Therefore, the formwork must be sufficiently rigid and tightly fitted to the existing concrete in a manner to minimize leakage of cement paste. The surface of the existing concrete will require adequate preparation, careful cleaning and pre-moistening. The replacement concrete should have final properties that match the existing concrete as closely as possible (strength, modulus of elasticity, creep co-efficient, etc.) To avoid temperature and shrinkage cracks, especially in the transition area, the type of cement, cement content and the water/cement ratio should be carefully evaluated. The use of plasticizers is recommended. Re-compaction /re-vibration may be required to improve the contact to the old concrete; however, care should be exercised to avoid a re-tempering of concrete after an initial set. Trial repairs on non-critical structures are essential before the main work is undertaken. For larger concrete volumes, minimizing the temperature difference between old and new concrete may require special procedure (cooling of new concrete and/or heating of old concrete). Type and duration of curing should be evaluated on a case by case basis. 6.1.5 Repair of cracks and other defects 6.1.5.1 General Before deciding the most appropriate methods/material for repairing/sealing cracks a study should be made on the cause of the cracks ascertain and whether they are active or dormant. Crack activity (propagation or breathing) may be determined by periodic observations with gauges, optical crack gauges, gauges or tell tales. 6.1.5.2 Reasons for occurance of cracks Cracks may occur due to creep, shrinkage, fatigue, fire, non-functioning of bearing, temperature gradient, chlorination and carbonation.

It is always desirable to attempt repairs to cracks at as early a stage as possible.

The hose to the injection device is connected to the nozzle of the adhesive packer. In the case of drilling packers, holes are drilled in the plane of the crack or may be inclined to the crack plane. The packer consists of a threaded metal tube which is encased in a rubber like sleeve and equipped with a nut. After insertion into the drill hole, the rubber sleeve is compressed by screwing down the nut. In this manner, the drill hole is sealed.

Appropriate certification is necessary to determine the qualifications of operating personnel. A system of quality control of the resin should be implemented to guarantee a consistent quality for each new application. These are the determination of the infrared composition (IR-Spectrum), the pot life, the viscosity, the density, the glass transition temperature as well as the development of the tensile strength during hardening and the hardened material. To avoid such expensive routine controls, some resin manufacturers have contracted with independent institutions to provide testing on a statistical sampling basis as a monitoring control. After successful testing, the resin batches are provided with a stamp of the testing institute as well as with information regarding durability. Stringent regulation for the use of resins in crack repair, especially where they must resists tensile stresses, is required to ensure the behavior of structural elements and to avoid additional damage that might be caused by the utilization of inadequate materials and procedures. Studies have shown that injection with epoxy/resins can be successfully accomplished. A reduction of adhesive strength will occur when the concrete surface of a crack is excessively moist. There is also a risk of reduction in the quality of epoxy resins when they are used for the repair of structural elements at extreme temperatures. Current experience indicates that epoxy resins can be successfully utilized when the temperature of the structural element is not less than 8°C. Because of the lack of experience with other resin (e.g. PUR) the 8°C limit should be maintained. For relatively hot structural elements, as compared to normal temperatures, a considerable reduction in the workability time of the resins may result. In these cases, the temperature of the structural element, in relation to its influence on the pot life should considerand pretesting may be appropriate. In many cases, only one side of the structural element to be injected is economically accessible. Experience has shown that one-side injection of a through crack in a large structural element or deep cracks are not always uniformly filled. An effective epoxy resin injection can still be accomplished when there is a cyclic width variation, as result of traffic loading, during injection and hardening, provided this variation does not exceed 0.05mm. Appropriate traffic limitations upto maximum of the first three days depending on temperature should be implemented if larger cyclic crack width variations are anticipated. In the case of large crack width, variations resulting from temperature injection should be co-ordinate such that hardening commences at maximum crack width opening. Thus, the filled crack will be subjected to a compressive stress, atleast for temperature variations. Experience indicates that there is no difference in behavior between an alkaline or carbonated concrete. That deformability of the resin, as a rule, is not sufficient to close active cracks tightly and durably in case these movements cannot be stopped. Under these circumstances the feasibility of expanding the crack and forming a permanent expansion joint should be explored. ####'),\n",

Reinforcement is placed across the cracks in suitable grooves which are suitably packed with non shrink concrete. Alternatively, if geometry permits, bars grouted in holes could be used for stitching. (ii) Jacketing This involves fastening of external material over the concrete to provide the required performance characteristics and restoring the structural value. The jacketing materials are secured to concrete by means of bolts and shear connector, bolts adhesives or by bond with existing concrete. Plate bonding using steel or composite fibre laminates are commonly used. Cementitious jacketing with micro concrete or concrete mixed with fibres is also used. 6.1.6 Pre-stressed concrete members For PSC members, the simple methods adopted are sealing and coating to fill out the cracks, grouting of cracks, repairing corrosion locations, and vacuum grouting using specially formulated resins to fill voids in the ducts. Some of the latest techniques include use of special chemical material formulations to satisfy the requirements like high tensile strength, special thermal properties etc. Some of the methods are common to those for RCC and the relevant details given earlier may be referred. 6.1.7 Corrosion protection of steel reinforcement 6.1.7.1 General The embedment of reinforcing steel in concrete normally provides adequate corrosion protection due to the alkalinity of the concrete surrounding the steel. Because of its alkalinity, concrete forms a passivating film on the surface of the encapsulated steel as a result of the presence of a saturated lime solution in the cement gel. Moist concrete typically has a pH value in excess of 12 which maintains the passivating film. This film is however de-passivated when the pH level is reduced below a value of approximately 10 to 11, or when a sufficiently high chloride concentration of about 0.4% chloride by weight of cement is present. In case the alkaline passivation film is destroyed or carbonation has reached the reinforcement or if moisture and oxygen are present, corrosion of the reinforcement will occur. In the absence of moisture (i.e., dry concrete) the corrosion process is inhibited, even if the concrete is carbonated, the alternate wetting and drying cycles increase corrosion. When reinforcement corrodes to a certain extent, the surrounding concrete cover tends to expand and leads to crack and spall or split. The cracks are caused by internally bursting stresses developing in the concrete as a result of a net increase in volume by the formation of corrosion products. Cracking/Spalling of the concrete cover will then permit the entry of water and other corrosion accelerating agents and the rate of corrosion accelerates. Non-expansive black rust associated with severe pitting and rapid corrosion can occur in low oxygen wet high chloride conditions in salted bridge decks, substructure and marine structures. ####'),\n",

This decision requires a case by case evaluation. If the corrosion protection of the reinforcing steel requires removal, the reinforcement will have to be exposed completely. The removal of rust from the uncovered reinforcing steel is generally accomplished by mechanical methods and hydro jetting or needle hammer and wire brushing. The removal of rust from the remote side of the bar is a difficult operation. A careful check and a repeated treatment of the individual bars is essential. (ii) Restoration of the protection This is similar to surface protection. All exposed reinforcement cleaned to bare metal should be protected immediately after preparation by using suitable corrosion inhibiting active or barrier coatings. These are proprietary materials to be used to provide corrosion resistance to the cleaned reinforcement, prior to application of the polymer modified mortar/concrete system. The materials that can be used to provide corrosion protection include: Active coatings for reinforcement: Arc coatings, which contain Portland cement or electrochemically active pigments, which may function as inhibitors or which may provide localized cathodic protection. Portland cement is considered to be an active pigment due to its high alkalinity. Typical product that can be used is a one-component polymer modified mineral based corrosion protection coat, which can be used for most repair applications. Barrier coatings: Arc coatings, which isolate the reinforcement from pore water in the surrounding cementitious matrix. Typical product that can be used is a two component Epoxy Resin based Zinc Rich Primer and Coating Material for use in repairs subject to aggressive environmental and chemical attacks. (iii) Preventive corrosion protection In the case where concrete cover is thin it may be desirable to seal the surface with an epoxy/ resin and solvent containing acrylic resins to prevent carbonation or corrosion. (iv) Cathodic protection The Cathodic Protection (CP) technique has been adopted to protect steel pipe lines and tanks from corrosion. In recent years it has been applied experimentally for the protection of reinforcing steel in concrete. Corrosion of steel in concrete proceeds by the formation of an electro-chemical cell with the concrete acting as coupling electrolyte, an anodic reaction occurs at some points on the steel surface and cathodic reactions consume the dissolve electrons on the remaining portion of the steel surface. The presence of chloride ions will produce a local de-passivation. By means of an externally applied small Direct Current (DC) the electric potential between the steel and concrete is shifted to a non-critical level. Thus, the electrons impressed in the steel forces the steel to act as a cathode ####'),\n",

Because of the high resistivity of the electrolyte concrete a uniform distribution of the protection current throughout the structure is necessary. But difficulties in achieving this and high costs have prevented cathodic protection being widely used in bridge decks and superstructures. However, research continues. It is accepted that there is still research required to be done before cathodic protection can be safely applied to pre-stressing steel. 6.1.8 Pre-stressing steel protection 6.1.8.1 General This section deals only with the repairs to pre-stressed reinforcement. It should, however be noted that the repair of the concrete and the normal reinforcement of a pre-stressed concrete structure will also require attention. In most cases, the pre-stressing force is still active and the stresses transferred to the concrete must be carefully considered, especially when repairing concrete in the anchorage zones. 6.1.8.2 Repair of the corrosion protection system for bonded tendons In the case of bonded tendons, the pre-stressing steel should be protected by the concrete cover and the cement grout in the ducts. (i) Vacuum Procedure Where the ducts are not completely filled with cement grout, subsequent grouting is necessary. This can be accomplished by vacuum grouting techniques. The advantage of this procedure is that the re-grouting of a duct requires only one drilled hole for each void. Such holes may be pre-existing in the form of the drilled holes used for tendon inspection or for obtaining samples for chloride content evaluation. Only a diameter adjustment may be required. A comparison between the assessed volume of the void and the amount of grout consumed will provide a control measure as to the success of the operation. Where discrepancies occur further additional borings will be required. A carful drilling procedure is required to avoid damaging of the pre- stressing steel. Special devices and techniques have been developed for this purpose, such as: slow drilling speed: special drill head, small impact force, drilling without flushing, sucking away of drill dust and automatic switch off when the drill bit reaches the duct. The repair must be accomplished as quickly as possible after opening of the duct to avoid corrosion. After grouting, a pressure has to be applied to expel residual air from the voids. There is a risk that for large air cushions, setting water will be displaced towards defects and produce paths which will impair the corrosion protection. Therefore, mortar having slow setting characteristics should be used. Special cements are available for this purpose. In special cases, surplus water in the duct can be evacuated. However, this process requires special equipment and knowledge. (ii) Grouting of the Ducts with Special Resins Where ducts filled with water cannot be drained through drilling or the vacuum process and drying is not possible, the water can be displaced by use of special resins with a long pot life and high specific weight. ####'),\n",

If an inspection indicates deterioration of the protection system, measures must be taken for its re-establishment. Such measures may be re-painting of steel ducts and protective caps over the anchorages, replacing of plastic pipes, taping of local pipe damage, filling of voids inside the pipes etc. Any materials used in the repair procedure must be compatible with the existing protection materials and with the pre-stressing steel. Some paintings, coating materials and special grouting mortars might contain substances that can produce stress corrosion and should, therefore not be used. 6.1.9 Honeycombed concrete There are two methods of repairing i.e. either the porous parts of the concrete are replaced by sound, watertight concrete or the porous zones are injected with a sealing material. First, all the porous zones of the structure must be carefully removed. Then they are replaced by fully compacted concrete or mortar with a water/cement ratio not exceeding 0.4. This procedure cannot be used where there is a continuing inflow of water. In this case, sealing can be accomplished by injection or use of underwater epoxy/resins 6.1.10 Repairs to damages/disintegrated/crushed components Depending on the extent and severity of damaged concrete may be rectified with the partial or full replacement either by higher grade of concrete, polymer modified or fiber reinforced concrete. 6.2 Strengthening of Concrete Structures 6.2.1 General Strengthening of structural members can be achieved by: – Replacing poor quality or defective material. – Replacement of defective/distressed members. – Providing additional load bearing material, – Providing additional members and – Re-distribution of the loading actions through imposed deformation of the structural system. 6.2.2 Materials The new load bearing material will usually be: – High quality/ grade concrete – Modified concrete – Fiber reinforced concrete – Reinforcing steel bars – Thin steel plates and straps, – Post-tensioning tendons or ####'),\n",

The strengthening part of the structure participates only under live load and ii. The strengthening part of the structure participates under live and dead load (or a part of it) It may be noted that these strengthening measures improve the strength but not necessarily the durability of the original structure. 6.2.3 Design aspects The strengthening of structures should be designed and constructed in accordance with related codes. If special codes for strengthening exist, they will of course be of assistance to the designer and contractors. However, this is seldom the case, and many problems in connection with strengthening are not dealt with in the codes. Typical problems of this kind are the transfer of shear forces between the old concrete and the new concrete applied for strengthening reinforcement and the post-tensioning of the existing structure which in some respects is different from the post-tensioning of a new structure etc. 6.2.4 Interaction between new and old concrete Satisfactory interaction/ bonding between existing concrete and new concrete is required in case of strengthening and repairs. As a rule, the aim is to get the structural parts, composed of different concretes, to act as a single unit similar to that of homogeneously cast structural component. To achieve this, the joint between old concrete and the new concrete should have requisite bond strength and must be capable of transferring tensile and shear stresses without relative movements of such a magnitude that the static behaviour is significantly affected. Furthermore, the joint must be durable i.e., the composite structural component must not change its mode of action with time in existing/ changed environment. While replacing large concrete volumes, the possibility of additional stresses as a result of heat of hydration has to be taken into account. Temperature differences can be limited by special measures, either, pre-heating of the old structural element and/or cooling of the fresh concrete. Differences in creep and shrinkage properties between old and new structural elements will require careful evaluation. Cracks may develop as a result of potential increases in constraint forces. Therefore, it becomes necessary to correctly detail and anchor the reinforcement. To implement the strengthening measure, it will be necessary to employ suitable mortars or concretes with low creep and shrinkage properties as well as minimal development of hydration heat. At the same time, an effort should be made to match, as closely as possible, the strength and modulus of elasticity of the new material with that of old material. These requirements will be influenced to a large extent by the composition and treatment of the new material. Vibrations due to traffic during hardening of the new concrete will have either negative influences or positive influences on its strength and its bond characteristics to the old concrete. This will depend on whether the vibrations are just sufficient to harden the concrete or too severe to ####'),\n",

Traffic shall be permitted only after complete setting/hardening of fresh material. In case it is observed that vibrations do not have any negative influence then the traffic could be permitted in a controlled manner while the repairs are in progress. However, if the vibrations due to traffic have negative influence then stoppage of traffic or speed limits may have to be considered during the hardening phase as necessary. The critical phase may be 3 to 14 hours after making the concrete. The form work should be so detailed that no relative movement occurs between old and new concrete. The reinforcement has to be sufficiently fastened so as to keep relative displacement small. 6.2.5 Strengthening of the reinforcement The strengthening of reinforcement can be achieved by: – Replacing of corroded reinforcement; – Providing additional reinforcement; * placed in the old cross section; * placed in an additional concrete layer; – Pre-stressing and – Bonded steel/ fiber plates. 6.2.5.1 Strengthening with reinforcing bars In the simplest case, a strengthening of the concrete tension zone is possible by the addition of reinforcing steel. Reinforcement should be added after reducing locked up stresses to the extent possible and after the concrete cover has been removed or after recesses have been cut in the cover to accommodate the added reinforcement. Afterwards the concrete cover must be re-established. An effective anchoring of the ends of the reinforcing steel is required. This can either be done by providing sufficient anchorage length for the steel in the concrete, or by steel plates and bolts with anchoring discs. The severely damaged reinforcing bars must be replaced. After unloading of the structure, the damaged sections of the corroded bar can be removed and the new reinforcing bar joined to the ends of the old ones by lapped splices, welding, or coupling devices. Transverse reinforcement is needed to assure a ductile behavior of the splice. Staggering of lapped splices is recommended unless the c/c distance between the bars is greater than twelve times the diameter of the bars. Lapped splices in a structural element can produce problems (congestion, interference with the proper compaction of concrete etc.) These difficulties may be overcome by the use of welded splices or couplers. 6.2.5.2 Strengthening by means of bonded steel/fiber plates The strengthening of concrete structures can be achieved by means of bonded plates. A behavior of these systems needs to address following aspects: Short-Term Behavior The load carrying capacity of this type of strengthening depends on the strength of the reinforcement, the concrete and the adhesive. At yielding of the reinforcement the adhesive will fail. Utilization of high strength reinforcement is limited by the dimensions, concrete strength, etc. ####'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'IRC:SP:40-2019', 'page': 57}, page_content='Concrete strength has a large influence on the efficiency of the strengthening. Theoretically, higher bond stress is to be expected from an increase in the elasticity of the reinforcing element and a decrease in the elasticity of the adhesive. Geometrical influences are primarily the dimension of the reinforcing elements. Their length, thickness and widths are decisive. The length of these elements has an influence on the bond stress intensity, which decrease with length. The bond stress will at the same time be influenced by the thickness. Therefore, glued on reinforcing elements behave differently from deformed bars which can be designed using the same permissible bond stress for all diameter. There is no proportionality between the width of the glued element and ultimate load, as an increase of width results in a reduction of bond strength. For a certain ratio of width to thickness the glued surface becomes a minimum. With increasing width, there is a risk of defects in the adhesive. Therefore, the width of the reinforcing element should be limited to a maximum of 200 mm. The thickness of the adhesive coat, within a range of 0.5 to 5 mm, has no significant influence on ultimate load. With increasing thickness of adhesive the slip between the reinforcing element and the concrete becomes greater. The concrete dimensions, according to previous test, do not appear to have any decisive effect. The surface condition of the steel is an important parameter. Suitable conditions can be achieved by sand blasting or by suitable method. Oil and grease should be removed by means of an organic solvent. As cleaned surfaces may corrode rapidly, a primer coating should be applied immediately. The primer serves as a corrosion protection and as an adhesive base for resin adhesive. It is a specially formulated solvent containing epoxy resin. Priming with zinc dust or hot-dip galvanizing is not suitable for glued on reinforcing elements. The strengthening of concrete structures can be achieved by means of bonded plates. Working principle of this system was plate-bonding technique, which was used. When the steel plate is bonded to concrete with epoxy adhesive the structural behaves will be composite structure. Three systems are commonly used: i) Steel Plate Bonding ii) GFRP/CFRP Bonding iii) Fiber Reinforced Cementitious Matrix Steel Plate Bonding It is an efficient method of increasing flexural capacity in beams, when applied on tension side; the success depends upon the epoxy adhesive, which transfers load from concrete to steel. It is constructability that was reason for major success, as well as plate bonding does not increase the section. Disadvantages were cutting of steel plates to suit the geometry, its weight and problem of corrosion. Fiber Reinforced Plastic Bonding This is in fact an extension of the steel plate bonding technique with tremendous advantage of light weight, ease of cutting and mouldability to suit any element and high chemicals resistance. ####'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'IRC:SP:40-2019', 'page': 58}, page_content='Two systems commonly used are based on Glass Fiber Reinforced Plastic (GFRP), and Carbon Fiber Reinforced Plastic (CFRP) FRP composites contain fibers of high tensile strength in polymer matrix of epoxy or vinyl ester. The rapid acceptance of this material is due to serviceability and ease of application without disturbing the structure. Fiber wrapping of columns provides passive confinement with increase of ductility and strength. Shear strengths are also increased. Wrapping gives excellent protection against explosions. FRP plates can be bonded with epoxies to increase flexural strengths. The limitation is the use of epoxy, which can change its characteristics during thermal variation and fire. Fiber Reinforced Cementitious Matrix This material system is similar to the CFRP Strengthening system, with only the matrix being a cementitious material, instead of an epoxy. This system addresses many of the shortcomings of the CFRP system. Some of these advantages include: i) Fire resistant – Up to Class A like for the concrete and mortar. ii) The system undergoes ductile failure (like steel reinforced concrete) and not brittle failure as in CFRP. iii) The system is Moisture/humidity resistant, no minimum substrate moisture content requirements. iv) The system is High temperature resistant unlike CFRP. v) The performance of the composite is similar to CFRP System. vi) Environmental friendly technology – Helps reduce the concrete and cement consumption. vii) Design guidelines for the systems are available in ACI 549, similar to ACI440 for the FRP. viii) The system is an easy technology, fast application – Once the concrete is repaired and restored to the original geometry, the FRCM system can be applied only after one day. For the pre-treatment of the concrete surface, the procedures discussed earlier apply. Blasting with fine grained blasting materials has proved to be effective (minimum pull-off strength 1.5N/ mm2). Coarse grained blasting materials will achieve a deeper roughening of the concrete surface, which results in an increased consumption of adhesive, but not necessarily in an improvement of bond strength. (i) Long-Term Behavior The question of long term behavior is of particular importance for these materials, the properties of which are highly time-dependent, of considerable importance are: creep, ageing and having fatigue strength. (ii) Creep The creep of resin adhesives is considerably greater than for concrete. In accordance with the current state-of-the-art, it can be assumed that the creep deformation abates relatively quickly. The adhesives may have very different creep ratios. In thin adhesive layers upto 3 mm the influence of creep is restricted by the cohesion of the adhesive. ####'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'IRC:SP:40-2019', 'page': 59}, page_content='(iii) Ageing Ageing is a change of properties resulting from mechanical, physical and chemical influence’s; e.g., air humidity, radiation, heat, weathering and water over period of time. Ageing varies widely between various adhesives. For strengthening of metal elements, ageing reduces strength such that the long-term strength is only approximately 50% of the short-term strength. For strengthening of concrete, a more favorable relationship exists, as the adhesive coating will be loaded considerably less. Epoxy resin/adhesive have a certain porosity, which will allow the penetration of water and other solutions. Exposure to water over long periods of time can cause resin/ adhesives to lose strength. Water sensitivity varies widely between various adhesives. (iv) Fatigue Strength The fatigue strength is approximately 50% of the short-term strength. This indicates that concrete with glued on reinforcement shows a more favorable behavior than those for glued metal structures, for which the dynamic strength for 10 millions load cycles is only 10% of the static strength. After a dynamic load has been applied, the static ultimate strength of the concrete structure with glued on reinforcement increases. This can be explained through a reduction of the bond stress speaks as a result of dynamic load. (v) Behavior at Failure The slip between the reinforcing element and concrete under tensile load has an approximately linear elastic behavior upto about half of the element and the adhesive layer. A further increase in the load leads to a progressive increase of the relative displacement. The elastic deformations results from the deformation of the adhesive layer. This slip starts at the loaded end of the reinforcing element and moves, with increasing load, to the centre of the element. In the plastic range, a slip deformation in the concrete sub-surface also occurs. The slip in the concrete develops some millimeters below the adhesive coat. A failure occurs suddenly, by abrupt elongation of the slip interface upto the end of the reinforcing element. In correctly designed structures with bonded plate reinforcement, a ductile failure with yielding reinforcement can be attained. Bolting on plates to prevent pealing failures is now normally accepted in some countries. It should however, be kept in mind that strengthening with steel plates with epoxy is a very workmanship sensitive method and so operations have to be under expert guidance only. 6.2.6 Strengthening with external pre-stressing 6.2.6.1 General In many cases, strengthening by means of external pre-stressing is a highly effective method. Both reinforced concrete and pre-stressed concrete structures can be strengthened by this method. The influence of the external pre-stressing on serviceability and ultimate limit states can be varied within wide limits by selecting different methods of introducing the tensioning force and using different profiles of the tendon. 6.2.6.2 Choice of system for external pre-stressing For external pre-stressing, only post-tensioning systems have been developed. For normal applications in pre-stressed concrete, post-tensioning systems should comply with the ####'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'IRC:SP:40-2019', 'page': 60}, page_content='requirements of the IRC codes for Acceptance and Applications of Post-Tensioning Systems. Both bonded and un-bonded tens can be used. If short pre-stressing elements are required, a post-tensioning system with minimal slipping in the anchorage (anchor set) should be chosen. Short pre-stressing elements can be sensitive to deviations due to construction tolerances (eccentricity, inclination and tolerance of the anchorage elements, the pre-stressing jacks, etc.) The use of lower strength high ductility threaded bars for partial pre-stressed could be considered as a more robust, simple and durable approach to avoid the very high local anchorage loads and durability problems with pre-stressing tendons. At deviation points (saddles) excessively small radii of curvature in the tendon should be avoided. 6.2.6.3 Special design consideration The strengthening by means of external pre-stressing can normally be designed as an ordinary pre-stressed member. While calculating pre-stress losses, however, it should be noted that the effect of creep and shrinkage may generally be less than in normal design, due to the age of the old concrete. The stress in an unbounded tendon in the ultimate state will be only slightly larger than that after pre-stress losses. 6.2.6.4 Protection against corrosion and fire The post-tensioning tendons should be protected against corrosion and fire to the same extent as in a newly built structure. The requirements for concrete cover are the same as for ordinary pre-stressed concrete structures. 6.2.6.5 Anchorages and deviators Since the external pre-stressing tendons are not embedded in the structure in the conventional manner special attention must be given as to how the force is introduced. The space requirements of the anchorage and the pre-stressing device should be taken into consideration. When strengthening an existing structure, it is not generally possible to provide spalling or bursting reinforcement behind the anchorages in the same manner as for a pre-stressed concrete structure. Spalling can be prevented by means of transverse pre-stressing. This pre-stressing has the further function of creating contact pressure between new and original concrete, such that the necessary shear stresses can be transferred through the joint. To ensure full interaction between the tendons and the rest of the structure, the same method can be used along the entire beam. But the required shear stress is often so small that it can be dealt with by means of non-tensioned reinforcement. Another method could be to locate the anchorages in compressive zone and design the anchor plates for a suitably reduced bearing stress. There are several methods available for the attachment of supplementary pre-stressing as mentioned below: i) Anchorage at girder ends ii) Additional supports, either in concrete or steel, fixed to the web of the box girder. This method provides a good distribution for the force in the external tendons, but creates high stresses locally where the pre-stressing force is introduced. Because of the very short transverse dowels the fixation of the tendon supports or brackets can be a problem. iii) Anchorages at existing diaphragms require extensive coring such that the tendon can pass through the diaphragm and be anchored at the backside.

These devices can be either concrete or steel. They are attached to the existing webs or flanges by short pre-stressing bolts or other type of anchors. These short bolts or dowels are very sensitive to anchorage seating losses. A large radius of tendon curvature should be used.

This method will require a distressing (unloading) of the original section. The composite cross section of precast elements and the original concrete is then re-stressed (loaded). This provides an improved transmission of pre- stress force throughout the composite section. With time a re-distribution of permanent load will occur as a result of creep and shrinkage. This strengthening method requires bond between the two structural elements at their interface. As a rule, a resin modified cement bond mortar layer is utilized. For treatment of the contact surface of the structure, the same operations as described earlier are necessary. In the fabrication of the precast elements, consideration should be given to the texture of the contact surface so as to provide increased bonding and shear characteristics at the interface. A sufficiently rough surface of the precast element can be obtained when the formwork of the contact surface is treated with a retarder. By early removal of the formwork and cleaning with water, a washed concrete surface can be achieved. A reduction of the largest grain size in the concrete on this surface is beneficial. Sufficient curing prevents micro-cracks between mortar and aggregates resulting from shrinkage. To roughen the surface, sand blasting is also suitable. If no special measures are taken during fabrication, the contact surfaces of the precast elements have to be treated like that of the original structure. 6.2.8 Strengthening by imposed deformation By means of imposed deformation, overstressed sections of a structure can be partially relieved. With this the load carrying capacity of the whole structure is improved. A self-equilibrated stress condition can be induced in the structure by relative displacement (raising and/or lowering) of the supports or by the introduction of new intermediate supports. It is important to note that relieving some sections of the structure will increase action effects (bending moment, shear, torsion etc) in other sections. A strengthening of these sections may be required. Another important factor is time: relative settlement of the supports, shrinkage and creep of the old structure and the new supporting elements will influence the distribution of the actions- effects in the structure. 6.2.9 Strengthening by other methods Concrete slabs or beams or columns (piers) can be strengthened by providing reinforced concrete jackets or overlays. Normally, thickness of new concrete layer should be less than about 1/3rd of the thickness of existing concrete. Proper attention to bonding and detailing of shear connections needs to be given. Replacement of structural system or additions of new system to the existing structure are also sometimes adopted to rehabilitate or strengthen a structure. In such cases, the existing internal stresses in the members must be carefully analyzed. Structural alterations could also be considered to reduce excessive vibrations. __________ ####'),\n",

The capacity and efficiency of bearings may be a limiting factor in situations where it is required to increase the load carrying capacity of a bridge. 7.2 Expansion Joints The expansion joints are not expected to last throughout the life of the bridge. It is, therefore, necessary that joints be replaced on a regular cycle. Based on the experience gained in India as well as in other countries, it may be reasonable to assume life of expansion joints around 20 years. Stipulations in IRC:SP:69 for replacement of joints shall be adhered to. The seals of the joints usually serve for 10 to 12 years with normal maintenance and may need replacement over a period of time. Some of the factors which would influence replacement are as under: \\uf0d8 Damage to seals such as tearing, loosening, cracking or displacement. \\uf0d8 Damage to other components \\uf0d8 Clogging of joints. \\uf0d8 Loosening of anchor plates. \\uf0d8 Damage to concrete near the joints leading to their malfunctioning. \\uf0d8 Leakage of water through the joints. \\uf0d8 Theft of the joints. Early bridge stock was provided with joints such as angle and plate, copper or asphaltic or finger type joints. Many of these joints may need replacement for better functioning of the /bridge deck if not function properly or deteriorated. Replacement is warranted with elastomeric or modular joints. It is vital to keep the joints watertight in order to prevent the ill-effects of moisture including corrosion on the beam ends, bearing shelves and substructure. Leaks must not be tolerated. It is not uncommon for joints to be watertight under the roadway but allow water to leak through at the kerb. Any replacement of joint shall be watertight and it shall be complete and full width of deck which includes carriageway, kerb, footpath and central verge. Where water tight joints cannot be provided, adequate means of draining the water passing through the joints shall be provided. As far as possible, the water should be kept out of contact with the concrete and the bearings. This is sometimes difficult to realise. If these measures fail, regular maintenance of the bearings and pedestals will at least prevent water from damaging the concrete. Joints may be filled with a sealant or filler. The filler material must be designed to ensure water tightness. Debris may prevent joint movement if the filler fails and may damage the joint sides or joint material, it may spall the sides of jointed slabs or cause over-stress in other bridge elements. Debris also tends to retain moisture and hence contribute to the deterioration of adjacent bridge component.

The fingers may also cave in or project up due to unacceptable deformation of the deck or differential settlement of foundation. Cracking and spalling of the pavement or deck in the area adjacent to the joint may cause subsequent failure of the joint by loosening the joint side support material. Joints can also get closed in balanced cantilever type bridges due to excessive deflection of cantilever or excessive hogging of main span. Movement of abutment must also be considered when inspecting joints. Such movement may either increase or decrease the joint opening or may even close the joint opening completely, preventing free expansion of the bridge. All damaged joints should be replaced.

Fairly good knowledge about hydrology and geotechnical situation is now available. Nevertheless solutions to hydraulic problems cannot be generalized. Unique solutions on case to case basis will have to be evolved. Some of the most common hydraulic deficiencies which could occur are as under: (a) Actual discharge in excess of that assumed in the design (b) Substantial increase in velocity of the river/ stream from that for which it was designed. (c) Increase in scour depth from the one adopted in design of foundations resulting in settlement of one or more foundations of the bridge. (d) Damage to the piers of the bridge due to the impact of floating debris brought by the stream during floods. (e) Oblique flow of the stream under the bridges, the angle of obliquity being more than that assumed in the design. (f) Meandering of the river and flow concentration in few spans may adversely affect stability of bridge. (g) If actual waterway provided is inadequate, river may overflow the banks or may cut across the approach road behind the abutments. (h) Location of the bridge is on curvilinear portion of the river. In high floods, abutment and penultimate pier on convex portion may get adversely affected. The causes for occurrence of these and other similar deficiencies have to be explored, examined and thereafter suitable remedial/ rehabilitation measures may be adopted so as to ensure safety and serviceability of the bridge structure. Some of the remedial measures adopted commonly for hydraulic problems are given below: 8.2 A bridge structure can substantially get damaged by floods. There are cases where rehabilitation of bridges becomes necessary on account of changes in the hydraulic parameters as manifest during flood conditions. The damages can be caused due to (i) abnormal floods, (ii) normal floods, if the design of the bridge does not cater adequately to the normal design floods and/ or (iii) as in a few cases, due to man-made changes in catchments of watercourse, e.g. the flood levels may exceed the original design levels substantially back water effect of a storage constructed downstream requiring raising of the bridge superstructure. 8.3 Floods can damage the bridge structure as well as the approaches and the protective measures. The bridge engineer is advised to refer to IRC:89 “Guidelines for Design and Construction of River Training and Control Works for Road Bridges” 8.4 If either due to inadequacy of original hydraulic design or due to the requirements of traffic as in a submersible bridge, the bridge level has to be raised, the same can be done by raising the superstructure with the help of jacks and extending the sub-structure in suitable stages by successfully resting them on the precast concrete pads which can then be embedded ####'),\n",

Where, however, the bridge deck is not to be raised but the bridge has to be protected from floods higher than the design floods, then designing the bridge as a submersible one and strengthening the same may have to be explored. At the same time suitable corrective measures may have to be adopted for decking and approaches, like provision of air-vents between the girders, protection of embankment, strengthening of piers by jacketing etc. 8.5 When the velocity and consequentially calculated scour in the stream is expected to increase and the substructure is found to be unsafe under such conditions, a solution of paving the bed with suitable aprons upstream and downstream can be considered to prevent the scour around the piers and the piers may also be strengthened by jacketing. 8.6 If flood damages to the bridge and approaches are of frequent nature then after careful investigations it may be necessary to extend the length of the bridge to provide adequate waterway. If the floods attack one side of the bridge, then additional spans could be provided on the affected side. Sometimes such situation can be handled by adequately designed spurs or groynes. In some cases, the returns beyond the abutments get damaged and may require replacement by returns on deeper foundations. Where a pier gets damaged beyond repairs, the span lengths could be changed either by locating a pier in between or if possible, by doubling the spans with suitable strengthening of the remaining substructure. 8.7 Bed protection can get damaged due to excessive turbulent floods or disturbance of stone protection. Surfaces of concrete or masonry can get eroded by high velocity of stream and sometimes cavitation can occur. 8.8 The bridge hydraulics is a highly specialized subject and so the treatment of the damages must be designed and carried out in consultation with a specialist. Use of hydraulic model studies for specific problems is also of considerable help in arriving at a proper solution. __________ ####'),\n",

This would help in assessing the performance of the work done. It would also bring out any further distresses that may occur. The various methods of monitoring the bridge structures are given in the succeeding paragraphs. 9.2 Methods of Monitoring During the distressed stage of a bridge and after the distressed bridge has been repaired, rehabilitated or strengthened, it is necessary to carefully monitor its behavior for a certain period of time to ascertain its performance and the efficacy of the measures adopted. The monitoring would involve carrying out certain laboratory and field tests as well as condition surveys and measurements to detect strains, movements, changes in reaction and deformations. 9.2.1 Inspections The first and the foremost requirements is to carry out routine inspections at more intervals than the normal structures, say immediately after distress is noticed and on completion of the remedial measures and during the use of the structure at the frequency of 6 months to one year depending upon the type of bridge and nature of distress thereafter for a period of 3 or 5 years. Use of mobile inspection units should be made wherever needed. The techniques of underwater inspection described earlier may also be adopted. 9.2.2 Changes in behaviour The usual methods adopted for monitoring the behaviour of a structure are: a) Observing deflections by periodically taking levels. The movements of bridges can be measured at the joints using slide gauges for maximum /minimum movements and reference pins for routine check. b) Visual observations for cracks, deflections, overall integrity, profile, functioning of bearings and hinges, corrosion stains. Particular note must be made of the cracking pattern, their width and length and whether cracks can be due to plastic shrinkage, settlements, structural deficiency, reactive aggregates, and corrosion. Signs of delamination, spalling, hollow or dead sound when tapped with hammer, honeycombing` and expansion of concrete should also be observed and levels of inspections have to be specified depending on individual cases. c) The change in the width of the cracks with the passage of time needs to be observed through tell-tales and gauges to know whether the cracks are active or passive. d) Plumb bobs are used to measure deviation from verticality for vertical members: Special tilt meters or inclinometers also could be used; (NB: Datum readings at the time of construction are essential). e) Opening of joints, particularly near the hinges, expansion joints etc. need to be observed. f) Redistribution of support reactions may also be measured in some cases. ####'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'IRC:SP:40-2019', 'page': 70}, page_content='9.2.3 Corrosion monitoring The use of permanent electrodes for accurate measurement of the corrosion potential of steel in concrete is also made. Use of current density or rebar probes and the use of corrosion rate monitoring probes can be made to meet the particular requirements. Careful selection of permanent monitoring equipment is required. The locations should be minimum and should be at the area of most active corrosion rate. Relatively thin steel wires are embedded in the structure near the reinforcement with permanent electrical connections to the tell-tales so that electrical resistance can be measured. Corrosion of tell-tales would cause an increase in the electrical resistance. Certain devices can be permanently embedded in the concrete for facility of later measurements of the extent and the rate of corrosion in future years. 9.2.4 Strain measurement The measurement of strains at critical sections or joints is another method of monitoring the behaviour of critical bridge elements. Electronic strain gauges are fixed at predetermined points. 9.2.5 Use of lasers Application of lasers in structural monitoring is finding increasing use in developed countries. In its simplest form the system consists of threading a laser beam through series of apertures in the plates fixed along the length of the beam, say along the soffit a girder or soffits or series of adjoining girders, (Fig 9.1). Similarly, a laser beam can also be directed vertically along the bearings or a column. The beam after passing through a series of apertures in plates thus fixed along this path reaches the light sensitive receivers at the farthest end. The failure of the beam in reaching the receiver requires further investigation because it could be due to some structural deformations of the members supporting the plates or due to some other reasons. A system of series of such laser beams can be provided in a structure and arrangement made to sound an alarm in case of blockage of light of any laser beam. Further refinement of the system could be made by attaching detectors to the structure along the path of the laser beam whereby any movement of the structure at the location of each detector would be continuously tracked by the latter relative to the laser beam and the actual overall behaviors of the structure at each detector location can be measured, recorded and analyses with the help of computers controlling timing and the operational sequence of the various detectors. Readings to the accuracy of even 0.1 mm are possible and continuous& constant 24 hours-a- day monitoring of a structure for its integrity and soundness is possible.

The measurement may include concrete strain at critical points, temperature effects, defections, movement of hinges, etc. 9.4 Training Monitoring of distressed bridges as well as rehabilitated bridges requires a great deal of skill and specialization. The engineers maintaining and inspecting such bridges therefore will need to be trained for such jobs. 9.5 Data Management Monitoring also requires setting up a data bank as a reference frame. This should be initiated at the time of construction. Testing, measurements and analysis of data are important to monitor the condition of the bridges. The sampling frequency of testing, therefore, has to be decided with the help of an expert. In the beginning, an extensive random sampling could be adopted to study the variability of results. Later, after studying the variability of the results limited target sampling may be decided.

These are: – Effective control of traffic and traffic restrictions, both in terms of speed as well as load, till the repairs are completed. – It is advisable to put up warning and cautionary boards about the speed of vehicles and weight restriction on the vehicles if applicable to any bridge after repairs/strengthening on both ends of the bridge. – Contingency plan for diversion of traffic and other necessary actions in case of any mishap. – Providing proper information to public through publicity and press and countering any ill-founded rumours. – Sometimes public-interest litigations also crop up which have to be handled properly. – Safety precautions. – Last but not the least, the morale of the engineers in charge of the work has to be maintained since they would be carrying out such repairs at a great risk to their own safety. 10.2 After completion of every job of rehabilitation of a bridge, an engineer must prepare a document to enable drawing lessons for the future so as to improve the bridge technology. Provision must be made in structures at the design stage itself for the possibility of future interventions like maintenance, repair, rehabilitation, strengthening and replacement of some components etc. A number of fruitful lessons can be learnt from the adverse experiences on the bridges and the consequent improvement of bridge technology. 10.3 Maintenance, Repair and Rehabilitation of State of the Art bridges like suspension, cable stayed, extradosed bridges etc. shall be carried out on the basis of specialized literature and expert opinion on the basis of advanced data collection method/techniques supplemented detailed quantitative analysis. 10.4 The new materials and techniques shall be used for Maintenance, Repair, Rehabilitation and strengthening with utmost care and due diligence with respect to the specifications, method of application and quality control promoter in addition to the respective IRC codes/guidelines. __________ ####'),\n",

Although brief procedure is also provided it for background information and for detailed procedure corresponding latest code as mentioned in Table 4.1 shall be referred. 1. CARBONATION TEST Use to determine the depth of the carbonated layer on the surface of hardened concrete by means of an indicator. The Carbonation of concrete on the surface results in loss of alkaline protection of the cover over the steel against corrosion. Carbonation of concrete occurs when the carbon dioxide, in the atmosphere in the presence of moisture, reacts with hydrated cement compounds. The carbonation process is also called depassivation. When an indicator is sprayed on the surface which is freshly exposed and the indicator turns the colour, it indicates the presence of carbonates and hence carbonation. The depth of carbonation is measured by spraying on the freshly broken surface of concrete with 0.10% solution of phenolphthalein. The 1% phenolphthalein solution is made by dissolving 1gm of phenolphthalein in 90 cc of ethanol. The solution is then made up to 100 cc by adding distilled water. On freshly extracted cores the core is sprayed with phenolphthalein solution, the depth of the uncoloured layer (the carbonated layer) from the external surface is measured to the nearest mm at 4 or 8 positions, and the average taken. If the test is to be done in a drilled hole, the dust is first removed from the hole using an air brush and again the depth of the uncoloured layer measured at 4 or 8 positions and the average taken. The concrete undergoes, a colour change (from pink to colourless) when PH value is below 10. If the concrete still retains its alkaline characteristic, the colour of the concrete will change to purple/ pink. If carbonation has taken place the pH will have changed to 7 (i.e. neutral condition) and there will be no colour change. If there is a need to physically measure the extent of carbonation it can be determined easily by spraying a freshly exposed surface of the concrete with a 1% phenolphthalein solution in 70 % ethyl alcohol. No specific equipment is required. The measurement of carbonation depth using the phenolphthalein solution can be carried out by spraying the indicator on the split surface of the concrete cylinder or core dust sample. The solution became a pink colour in the un-carbonated concrete and can be differentiated from the carbonated concrete, giving a distinct boundary marking the carbonation front. A carbonation depth up to an accuracy of 5 mm can be identified with the naked eye. It directly gives the effective cover available to the reinforcement before the start of corrosion. Factors affecting the test results are: i. Humidity- Higher humidity results in greater carbonation process. Ideally, 50-70% lower humidity means not enough water available for carbonation. ii. Temperature - The carbonation reaction rate increases with temperature. iii. Low Rain Precipitation- When the concrete surface is wetted by rain, the diffusion ####'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'IRC:SP:40-2019', 'page': 76}, page_content='of CO is momentarily blocked as the pores get filled with water. The diffusion of 2 CO will continue once the concrete starts drying. Carbonation is then expected 2 to be more severe in those regions with low precipitation and particularly on those parts of the structures that remain sheltered from the rain. iv. High Concentration of CO - The normal concentration of CO in the atmosphere 2 2 is approximately 0.03%. However, in certain areas as in bridges with heavy traffic, or close to industrial areas, the level of CO contamination may reach and 2 even exceed 0.1 % concentration. The method is simple, fast and accurate and no equipment is necessary. The contour maps of the surface of the concrete member having varying carbonation depths can be prepared to get some insight to the durability aspects of the structure. The tests results do not assist in determination of concrete durability directly. Minor surface damage shall occur and if not treated it may be the source of reduced cover to the reinforcement. This technique is mostly used for assessment of the surface carbonation of reinforced concrete members to determine the possibility of corrosion and hence establish the durability of the section. There may exist a partially carbonated zone, where the pH value is not easily detected by phenolphthalein indicator. The carbon dioxide could react at the depths greater than those indicated by the indicator. The test shall not be considered as a tool for estimating the structural properties of the reinforced concrete member. 2. SULPHATE CONTENT To determine the sulphate content through the concrete samples. The concrete attached by sulphate has a characteristic white appearance. The quantity of sulphate is estimated by the precipitation of barium-sulphate and sulphate confined by identification of Calcium Sulpho Aluminate. Weigh into a 400 ml beaker 5 ± 0.005 g of the analytical or sieved sample. Disperse with 50 ml of water and add 10 ml of concentrated hydrochloric acid. Add 50 ml of hot water, cover the beaker and boil the solution gently for 5 min to 10 min. Filter through a medium ash less filter paper. Wash the residue thoroughly with hot dilute hydrochloric acid (1+49). Add three drops of the methyl red indicator and heat the filtrate to boiling. Just neutralize to yellow with the dilute ammonium hydroxide solution. Immediately add 1 ml of concentrated hydrochloric acid and then add drop wise to the boiling solution 10 ml of the barium chloride solution. If excess ammonium hydroxide was added, 1 ml of concentrated hydrochloric acid may not be sufficient to obtain the required acid solution and the barium sulphate precipitate will then be contaminated. In this case the test shall be repeated. Boil gently for 5 min, keep the solution at just below boiling for 30 min and allow to stand at room temperature for 12 hrs. to 24 hrs. Filter through a slow ashless filter paper and wash free from chlorides with hot water. Transfer the paper and contents to a weighed silica or platinum crucible and burn off the paper without flaming. Ignite the precipitate at 800 ºC to 900 ºC until constant mass is achieved.

Exposure to Atmospheric carbon dioxide. The samples from other NDT tests like core cutting, pull out can also be used. 3. CHLORIDE CONTENT To determine the Chloride content in the concrete. Salts of thiocyanates and thiosulphates are increasingly used as accelerating admixtures in place of chlorides. These compounds can interfere with the determination of chloride content. The Chloride content in concrete is measured in laboratory by Mohr’s method using potassium Chromate as indicator in a neutral medium or by using Volhard’s volumetric titration method in acidic medium. Weigh into a stoppered 500 ml conical flask 5 ± 0.005 g of the analytical or aggregate separated sample. Disperse with 50 ml of water and add 10 ml of nitric acid. Add 50 ml of hot water, boil for 4 min to 5 min and keep warm for 10 min to 15 min. Cool to room temperature and add a measured excess of the silver nitrate standard solution. Add 2 ml to 3 ml of 3.5.5 - trimethylhexanol stopper the flask and shake vigorously to coagulate the precipitate. Add 1 ml of iron I II indicator solution and titrate with the thiocyanate solution to the first permanent red colour.

SCHMIDT/REBOUND HAMMER TEST It is used to estimate the compressive strength of concrete in an existing structure and as a quality control measure of a new construction. It works on the principle that the rebound of an elastic mass depends on the hardness of the surface against which the mass impinges. The equipment used for the test is called Schmidt Rebound Hammer which is shown in the Fig. A1. The main components of the equipment include the outer body, the plunger, the hammer mass, and the main spring. While testing a concrete surface, the plunger is held perpendicular to the concrete surface and the body is pushed towards the concrete. This movement extends the spring holding the mass to the body. When the maximum extension of the spring is reached, a latch located in the equipment releases, and the mass is pulled towards the surface by the spring. The mass hits the shoulder of the plunger rod and rebounds because the rod is pushed hard against the concrete. During rebound the slide indicator travels with the hammer mass and stops at the maximum distance the mass reaches after rebounding. It is essential to calibrate the equipment by testing the same on an anvil supplied with the equipment. Fig. A1 Schmidt Rebound Hammer & Working Principle ####'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'IRC:SP:40-2019', 'page': 79}, page_content='Rebound hammer test data are recorded in terms of rebound numbers. Generally, up to 10 readings are taken on a square grid from a test location and the average of readings is calculated. It indicates the average surface hardness of concrete at a given location. Each hammer is furnished with correlation curves developed by the manufacturer using standard cube specimens to convert the average rebound number into the compressive strength. However, the use of such curves is not recommended because the material and testing conditions may not be similar to those encountered in the field / laboratory. Typically the correlation between the rebound number and the strength of the concrete is carried out as given below: For an existing structure: a) A minimum of 3-5 concrete cores preferably of size 150 mm Ø x 300 mm or 100 mm Ø x 200 mm are extracted from different locations of the structure b) The cores are conditions as specified in IS 516. After capping, cores are placed in a compression-testing machine under an initial load of approximately 15% of the ultimate load to restrain the specimen. c) About 15 hammer rebound readings are taken, 5 on each of 3 vertical lines 120° apart, against the side surface in the middle two thirds of each core. Testing the same spot twice shall be avoided, and average is calculated. d) The cores are then tested in a UTM to determine the concrete compressive strength. e) The core compressive strength is converted into the cube compressive strength by multiplying the core strength by 1.25, as suggested in IS: 516 f) The rebound numbers are plotted against the compressive strengths on a graph g) A correlation is then developed between the average rebound numbers and the core compressive strength by fitting a curve or a line by the method of least squares. This correlation may be used to estimate the compressive strength of concrete in the structure at different locations from average rebound hammer. For quality control purposes of under-construction structure: a) About 30 concrete cubes of 150 mm size are made using the same mix proportions to be employed for the construction. b) The specimen are cured under standard moist-curing room conditions, keeping the curing period the same as the specified control age in the field. c) The cubes are placed in a compression-testing machine under an initial load of approximately 15% of the ultimate load to restrain the specimen. d) About 16 hammer rebound readings are taken, 4 on each of sides, avoiding testing the same spot twice, and average is calculated. e) The rebound numbers are plotted against the compressive strengths on a graph. ####'),\n",

This correlation may be used to estimate the compressive strength of concrete in the structure at different locations, from average rebound hammer, at the specified age, to monitor the quality in the construction. Factors affecting the test results are Rebound number may be affected by (i) Smoothness of the test surface, (ii) Size, shape and rigidity of the specimen, (iii) Age of the specimen, (iv) Surface and internal moisture conditions of concrete, (v) Type of coarse aggregate, (vi) Type of Cement (vii) Carbonation of the concrete surface etc. Carbonated surfaces generally give higher rebound number readings, upto about 50% for a carbonation depth of 20 mm, (viii) the angle of striking the concrete and (ix) type of mold. This allows survey to produce contour maps of the surface of the concrete member having varying rebound numbers. The method is simple, fast and accurate and the instrument used is very handy. The method gives only the surface hardness but does not give direct estimation of compressive strength. A correlation curve, specific to the concrete in the structure, is required to be developed to correlate the rebound number to compressive concrete strength. Coefficients of variation for compressive strength for a wide variety of specimens average at 19 % and exceeded 30% for some groups of specimens, and the same can be narrowed down considerably by developing a proper correlation curve for the hammer, which allows for various variables discussed earlier. The depth of influence of the test extends up to about 20 mm from surface. The probable accuracy of estimation of concrete strength in a structure is ±25%, however for properly cast, cured concrete specimen, and tested under laboratory conditions by a properly calibrated hammer, an accuracy of ±15 and ±20% can be achieved. Commercial rebound hammers with analog or digital display of the readings are available. Some of the recent equipments display the averagebound number. 5. COVER METER Cover Meters are used to detect steel reinforcement bars and estimate concrete cover over rebar and diameter of the steel reinforcement bar in concrete structures. The method works on electro-magnetic principles. An electromagnetic field is generated by the search head of the meter. When a reinforcing bar or other magnetic metal object lies within this field, the lines of force become distorted. The disturbance caused by the presence of the metal in turn produces a local change in field strength as detected by the search head and indicated by the meter. Cover meters operating by monitoring two different effects of electromagnetism are available; eddy current effect or magnetic induction effect. Eddy current method works at higher frequencies (> 1 kHz) and is sensitive to any conducting material in the vicinity of the search head, while ####'),\n",

In both the methods, the proximity and orientation of the metal to the search head affect the meter reading.

An application of typical cover meter is shown in the Fig. A2. Fig. A2 Cover Meter in Use It is possible to obtain the location of reinforcing steel bar, determine the depth of concrete cover and estimate the barsize using the cover meters. Cover-meters can measure the cover with an accuracy of 5 mm up to a depth of about 75 mm.

The technique is the least complicated and least expensive of all the NDT techniques. Under the most favourable site conditions, indicated cover can be measured to an accuracy or + 1 to 4 mm approaching that obtainable in the laboratory when the bar size is known. The various limitations are:(i) It is a slow and labour intensive method. (ii) The level of accuracy may vary with congested reinforcement and severity of corrosion (iii) The equipment needs to be calibrated before use (iv) The equipment may not work if non-magnetic reinforcement such as galvanised bars or FRP bars are used in the structure. 6. GROUND PENETRATING RADAR A high frequency pulsed radar can be used to detect any metallic or non-metallic objects, deterioration like delamination and the other types of defects, which can occur in bare or overlaid reinforced concrete decks.

Since radar yields information on the structural profile across the depth of the object being tested, it is at present the only commercially available non-destructive method for the inspection of concrete bridge decks that have asphalt overlays. GPR is still reliant on the experience of the operator. The radar waves can never penetrate through metals, so testing the interior of metal ducts, e.g. for un-grouted areas is not possible. Ground radar surveys are used on bridge structures for assisting load assessments and as a follow-up to routine inspections. A GPR survey is able to locate internal defects for the accurate targeting of intrusive investigations. On masonry arch structures, locate defects and identify backing on the haunches of the arch. A large number of commercial equipments available, hand held and tailor made to reach all locations and detect any structural discrepancies. Radar may fail to locate small delaminated areas, especially those that are only 0.3 m wide or less, because the strong reflections from the rebars tend to cover reflections from delamination. 8. RADIOGRAPHY Radiography techniques are applied on the pre-stressing cables to detect defects in the cable and to examine the quality of grouts within the ducts. Radiography is also used to locate the position of reinforcement bar in reinforced concrete, estimates can be made of bar diameter & depth below the surface, to determine presence of voids, cracks and foreign materials, and variations in the density of the concrete. The amount of radiation lost depends on the quality of radiation, the density of the material and the thickness traversed. The beam of radiation, which emerges from the material, is usually used to expose a radiation sensitive film so that different intensities of radiation are revealed as different densities on the film. The Principle of Radiography is shown in Fig. A5. Fig. A5 Principle of Radiography ####'),\n",

In short the procedure is as below: x ray tube used to produce x-rays, which is the basic requirements, namely (i) source of electrons as a heated filament, (ii) means of directing and accelerating the electrons as a high voltage supply, and (iii) target which the electrons can bombard, normally in the form of heavy metal target. The Tube (Fig. A6) consisting of a glass envelope in which two electrodes are fitted, a cathode and an anode. The cathode serves as a source of electrons. Applying a high voltage across the cathode and the anode first accelerates the electrons, and then stopping them suddenly with a solid target fitted in the anode. Stopping the fast moving electrons results in the generation of x-rays. The back-scatter techniques is based on intensity of x-rays can be used to detect the voids in grouts and testing strands or wires which are broken or are out of position. Fig. A6 A typical X-ray tube A radioactive isotope source produces radiation by electron or nuclear energy transitions usually of a single energy or a few discrete energies. Isotope sources emit photons continuously and do not require electrical power. The specimen absorbs radiation but where it is thin or where there is a void, less absorption takes place. Since more radiation passes through the specimen in the thin or void areas, the corresponding areas of the film are darker. The relationship between the intensity of photons incident and transmitted is: I = I e(–µx) 0 where, I is transmitted photon intensity, I is incident photon intensity, μ is attenuation coefficient 0 and x is thickness of object. Factors affecting the test results are: The penetrating ability of portable x-ray units is limited and is used for members less than 300 mm thick. Major disadvantage is the health risk associated with the radiation. High degree of skill and experience is required for exposure and interpretation. The equipment is relatively expensive.

The main limitation of radiography is that for thick sections, high-energy is required. 9. INFRA-RED THERMOGRAPHY Infra-red thermography is used for the determination of delamination in bridge decks and columns exposed directly to sun. The method works on the principle that discontinuity within the concrete, such as delamination, interrupts the heat transfer through concrete. Radiation is incident on the surface and that is reflected or absorbed. Absorbed radiation is for the reflected from the sub-surface defect leading to local heating. If this radiation falls on a concrete surface, then if the delaminations or the void was not there, then lot of radiation will simply get absorbed into the concrete. Whereas, if the void or a delamination present within the concrete surface the radiation gets reflected back to the concrete surface and a patch which has higher temperature than the neighbouring patches obtained. This difference in temperature observed on a concrete surface is used for detecting defects within the concrete surface. In short the procedure is as below: The equipment can be truck mounted permitting a lane width to be scanned by a single pass. The differences in surface temperature are measured by sensitive infrared detection system which consist of infrared signal, control unit and display screen. The images get recorded on the photographic plates or video tapes. A typical Infrared Thermography camera is shown in Fig. A7.

The disadvantage of thermography is that while a positive result is valid, a negative result may not be always reliable because it relates to results under conditions prevailing at the time of tests. Nevertheless, the method itself has a considerable promise as a rapid screening tool for determining whether a more detailed investigation is required. The presence of voids or spalling can be found out but not the depth. This technique is mostly used for assessment of the cracks, anomalies and spalling on the concrete surface. Higher resolution cameras with continuous plots of bridge deck are possible to do a very fast analysis of cracks, anomalies and spalling in the deck. The range of camera’s available are varied and unless a very high resolution/pixelate camera is used, the results may not be accurate and subject to judgment. 10. ULTRA SONIC PULSE VELOCITY TEST It is used for assessment of uniformity/integrity of concrete in structures. It can also be used to measure changes occurring with time in the properties of concrete, correlation of pulse velocity and strength as a measure of concrete quality. The quality of concrete can be assessed by passing through concrete the ultra-sonic pulse and measuring its velocity. Measured values may be affected by surface texture, moisture content, temperature, specimen size, reinforcement and stress. Measured Time taken by wave to pass through the particular medium is empirically correlated to the uniformity or integrity of the concrete section. Calculation of ultrasonic pulse velocity taking into account time passing through testing base and length of the same as follows: T= L / V In short the procedure is as under: i. This test is performed by using a transducer & receiver which are calibrated & applied with oil/grease/sticky material on concrete surface where integrity or homogeneity is to be measured. This placement can be done in three different types i.e. Place the transducer and Receiver on the Opposite face (Direct) or Adjacent face (Semi Direct) or on same face (Indirect). ii. When the pulse generated is transmitted into the concrete from the transducer, the first waves to reach the receiving transducer are the longitudinal waves, which are converted into an electrical signal by transducer. Electronic timing circuits enable the transit time T of the pulse to be measured. The methods of propagating ultrasonic pulses are given in Fig. A8 below: ####'),\n",

UPV Testing has the possible solution to judge the porosity, density, strength of concrete section provided proper correlations are established. Generalised correlations are not suitable to define strength of the concrete sample. This technique is mostly used for assessment of the integrity, homogeneity and uniformity of the concrete members where there is any ambiguity on the concrete integrity.

Endoscopy consists of usually flexible viewing tubes which can be inserted into holes drilled in the bridge components or into a cable duct of the pre-stressed concrete. A light is provided by optical fibres from external source. The endoscopes are available with attachments for a camera or a TV Monitor and are used for detailed examination of parts of the bridge structure which cannot otherwise be assessed.

ACOUSTIC EMISSION TEST Test is used to check detect locate and characterise damages faults in structures and its components. The stresses acting on the material produce the local deformation, which is breakdown of the material at specific places. This material breakdown produces acoustic emission i.e. an elastic wave that travels outward from the source, moving through the body until it arrives at a remote sensor. Acoustic emissions can be detected in frequency ranges under 1 kHz, and have been reported at frequencies up to 100 MHz, but most of the released energy is within the 1 kHz to 1 MHz range. Rapid stress-releasing events generate a spectrum of stress waves starting at 0 Hz, and typically falling off at several MHz. Acoustic Emission Testing process is given in Fig. A10 below: Fig. A10 Acoustic Emission Testing Process The Acoustic Emission is based on the detection and conversion of high frequency elastic waves to electrical signals. This is accomplished by directly coupling piezoelectric transducers on the surface of the structure under test and loading the structure. Sensors are coupled to the structure by means of a fluid couplant and are secured with tape, adhesive bonds or magnetic hold downs. The output from each piezoelectric sensor (during structure loading) is amplified through a low-noise preamplifier, filtered to remove any extraneous noise and further processed by suitable electronic equipment. AE sources are determined by calculating the difference in time taken for the wave to arrive at the different transducers. The results may be affected due to (i) Geometric spreading, (ii) Scattering at structural boundaries and (iii) Absorption Compared with ultrasonic, radiographic or the other NDT methods, the source of information is derived by creating some effect in or on the material by external application of energy or compounds. AE relies on energy that is initiated within the component or material under test.

The instrumentation of Acoustic Emission must provide some measure of the total quantity of detected emission for correlation with time and/or load.

GALVANO-STATIC PULSE TRANSIENT METHOD Method is used to determine the instantaneous corrosion rate of reinforcing steel in concrete. The basic principle is the same as that of LPR method (galvano-static perturbation), however this is a transient polarization technique working in the time domain. The small anodic perturbation current results in change of reinforcement potential which is recorded by a reference electrode (usually located at the centre of the counter electrode) as a function of polarization time. The resistance offered by the system to passage of current comprises of an ohmic resistance R Ω (resistance from concrete between the surface electrode and the steel bar, the double layer capacitance (C ) at the surface of the steel, and the charge transfer resistance (R ).

HALF -CELL POTENTIAL MEASUREMENTS These are used to determine the corrosion activity of the reinforcing steel in the concrete and evaluating susceptibility of rebar corrosion in the given environment concrete matrix. The electrode (half-cell, Fig. A14b) potential of reinforcement embedded in concrete provides a measure of the corrosion risk and indicates whether an electro-chemical reaction is in progress on the electrode surface.

HAMMER RAP/HEAVY CHAINS Hammer/Chains can be used to locate delaminations in concrete bridge decks by sounding technique. The test is carried out as per ASTM D 4580-03. Chain drag and hammer sounding are generally categorized as crude vibrational modal tests. The operator drags chains or strikes a hammer on the deck, listening to the resulting sound. A clear ringing sound represents a sound deck while a mute/hollow/dull sound represents a delaminated area. The hollow sound is a result of the flexural oscillations of the delaminated section of the deck, creating a drum-like effect. Flexural oscillation of a delaminated area is typically in a 1 to 3 kHz range i.e. audible range to humans. The perceived delaminated areas are outlined on the deck surface.

IMPACT-ECHO This method is primarily used to determine the thickness of concrete slabs, pavements, bridge decks, walls, or other plate-like structures, locate poor consolidation, voiding and honeycombing in reinforced concrete, detect areas of delamination in concrete, detect de-bonding of an overlay, detect degree of grouting in post-tensioning ducts in plain, RCC and pre-stressed concrete elements. The impact-echo technique is based on generating a short-duration, low frequency, stress pulse by mechanical impact on a concrete surface. The pulse propagates into the member along spherical wave fronts as P and S waves. These waves are reflected by the boundaries of, internal interfaces or flaws in, or the opposite face of, the concrete member, and are received by receiver or transducer. The time of receipt, or the frequency of the received wave is used to estimate the depth of the member, or locate the flaws. The equipment for the test method consists of an impact source, a receiver and a data acquisition system with appropriate software. Impact sources with shorter-duration impacts (20 to 60 ms), such as small steel spheres and spring-loaded spherically tipped impactors are commonly used for detecting flaws within slab and wall structures ranging from 0.15 to 1 m thick. However steel spheres are convenient impact sources because they produce well-defined pulses (approximately a half-cycle sine curves), and the contact time is proportional to the diameter of the sphere. Conically tipped, piezoelectric displacement transducers are used as the receiver as such transducers respond to surface displacement over a broad frequency range. The data acquisition system may be a digital waveform analyzer, a portable computer with data acquisition hardware and software, or a dedicated impact-echo instruments. The velocity of the p-wave generated by the impactor is determined first by impacting on the concrete surface where its thickness is already known (Fig. A18 & A19). The velocity is calculated by dividing the thickness of the member and the time of the receipt of the pulse. The impactor is then struck at different locations on the surface of the concrete member. The depth of the delamination, flaw or honeycombing, from the surface is then determined from the time of receipt of the pulse and the velocity of the p-wave. Note that it would take lesser time for the wave to travel the delamination / flaw / honey combing in the member and return to surface after reflection.

As the contact time decreases and the pulse contains higher- frequency (shorter-wavelength) components, smaller defects can be detected. In addition, short- duration impacts are needed to accurately locate shallow defects. Contact with the concrete is necessary to perform the test, hence the bituminous wearing course on a bridge deck need to be opened at the test location. Impact-echo is more reliable when relatively small areas are delaminated so as to indicate early signs of deterioration. Commercial equipment on impact echo is available to determine the thickness of the concrete bridge deck slabs, plates, pavements etc. Wireless echo system is also available from some manufacturers for use of inspection team with limited man-power. 18. LINEAR POLARIZATION RESISTANCE (LPR) TECHNIQUE LPR is used to determine the instantaneous corrosion rate measurement of reinforcing steel in concrete. The method works on the principle that the polarization resistance of a corroding system is inversely proportional to its corrosion rate. An induced change (perturbation) in the potential or current of a corroding system is called polarization. The polarization resistance is determined ####'),\n",

It has been shown that the applied voltage and the change in current (or vice versa) are linearly related within this small perturbation, and the proportionality constant is called linear polarization resistance (LPR). LPR technique has been shown to be an effective electrochemical method for measuring rate of corrosion of steel reinforcement in concrete structures. The polarization resistance, R , of the steel is calculated from the equation p R =∆E/∆I p Where, ∆E is applied voltage, ∆I is the change in (step) current when the metal is polarized (about 20-50 mV). The corrosion rate, I , is then calculated as follows: corr I =B/Rp corr where, B is the Stern–Geary constant, a value of 25 mV has been adopted for active (corroding) steel and 50 mV for passive (non-corroding) steel. The corrosion current density, icorr, can be calculated if the surface area, A, of Steel is known i = I /A corr corr Portable commercial equipment is available for use at site and in the laboratory (Fig. A20) Fig. A20 Schematic of the test set up for Linear Polarization Resistance measurement In the commercially available equipments, galvanostatic polarization is often employed. In the conventional test procedure, a current perturbation to a corroding steel reinforcement is applied through an auxiliary electrode placed on the concrete surface (Fig. A20). In the process, the surface area of steel that is lying directly beneath the auxiliary electrode is assumed to be polarized. However, the current flowing from the auxiliary electrode remains unconfined and spreads laterally over an unknown, larger area of steel. Therefore, to confine the applied current, ####'),\n",

In order to select an appropriate level for the confinement current two sensor electrodes are placed between the inner and outer auxiliary electrodes. The potential difference between these sensor electrodes is monitored and a confinement current selected to maintain this potential difference throughout the LPR measurement. Fig. A21 Guard ring test set-up The equipment directly displays the corrosion current density i , when the diameter of the bar corr being tested is fed into the equipment. The actual loss of steel is calculated using Faraday’s laws as per ASTM G 102. The corrosion potential measurement may be affected due to (i) lack of correct electrical contact between the equipment and the reinforcement, (ii) A lack of correct electrolytic contact between auxiliary sensor and concrete surface, (iii) The existence of stray currents, (iv) temperature and humidity and (v) Flow of current from the auxiliary electrode is unconfined and can spread laterally over an unknown larger area of steel, which can affect the results. It is very suitable for on-site condition assessment of steel reinforcement w.r.t corrosion in concrete structures. The instantaneous corrosion rate of steel can be obtained. The method can be applied regardless of the thickness of concrete cover and the rebar size or detailing. Limitations are: (i)This method assesses only the instantaneous condition of the steel reinforcement, but cannot predict its future condition. Concrete surface condition w.r.t moisture, has a significant role in measurement (ii) On very dry concrete surfaces having concrete resistivity, ρ> 1000 Ωm, measurements are difficult to obtain or the method gives misleading results. (iii) Difficulty in selecting a suitable equilibration time at which to monitor the current response to the applied potential shift. This is because the resistance is made up from a number of different mechanisms occurring within the concrete which include those interfacial resistances at the surface of the bar which are directly related to corrosion and those resistances associated with the bulk concrete and, to calculate the corrosion rate accurately it is necessary to select the measurement time required to evaluate those processes directly associated with corrosion but to exclude those processes associated with the bulk concrete. Method can be used to assess the present corrosion condition of the reinforcement, that is, to discriminate between corroding and non-corroding (passivated) zones. It may also be used to evaluate the effectiveness of a repair work. ####'),\n",

PENETRATION RESISTANCE/WINDSOR PROBE TEST Probes can be used to determine the resistance to penetration of hardened concrete by either a steel probe or pin. Probe penetration relates to some property of the concrete below the surface, and within limits, it has been possible to develop empirical correlations between strength properties and the penetration of the probe. The Windsor probe consists of a powder-actuated gun or driver, hardened alloy steel probes, loaded cartridges, a depth gauge for measuring the penetration of probes, and other related equipment. The probes have a tip diameter of 6.3 mm, a length of 79.5 mm, and a conical point. Probes of 7.9 mm diameter are also available for the testing of concrete made with lightweight aggregates. The rear of the probe is threaded and screws into a probe driving head, which is 12.7 mm in diameter and fits snugly into the bore of the driver. The test can also be performed with a pin. Two different methods available for resistance test i.e. with Probes or with Pins. The probe is driven into the concrete by the firing of a precision powder charge that develops energy of 79.5 m kg. For the testing of relatively low strength concrete, the power level can be reduced by pushing the driver head further into the barrel. The area to be tested must have a brush finish or a smooth surface as it affects the result. The evaluation of test can be done only after a co-relation is established with a sample; practical procedure for developing such a relationship is outlined below. i. Prepare a number of 150 mm × 300 mm cylinders, or 150 mm3 and companion 600 mm × 600 mm × 200 mm concrete slabs covering a strength range that is to be encountered on a job site. Use the same cement and the same type and size of aggregates as those to be used on the job. Cure the specimens under standard moist curing conditions, keeping the curing period the same as the specified control age in the field. ii. Test three specimens in compression at the age specified, using standard testing procedure. Then fire three probes into the top surface of the slab at least 150 mm apart and at least 150 mm in from the edges. If any of the three probes fails to properly penetrate the slab, remove it and fire another. Make sure that at least three valid probe results are available. Measure the exposed probe lengths and average the three results. iii. Repeat the above procedure for all test specimens. iv. Plot the exposed probe length against the compressive strength, and fit a curve or line by the method of least squares. The 95% confidence limits for individual results may also be drawn on the graph. These limits will describe the interval within which the probability of a test result falling is 95%. The probe is simple to operate, requires little maintenance except cleaning the barrel and is not sensitive to operator technique. The test is relatively quick and the result is achieved immediately provided an appropriate correlation curve is available. Access for measurement is only needed to one surface. The correlation with concrete strength is affected by a relatively small number of variables. Pullout test can be used advantageously for inaccessible areas and section having dense rebar placement. ####'),\n",

The minimum thickness of the member, which can be tested, is about three times the expected depth of probe penetration. The distance from the rebar affects the reliability of test. The distance from reinforcement can also have an effect on the depth of probe penetration especially when the distance is less than about 100 mm. The test is limited to <40 MPa and if two different levels are used in an investigation to accommodate a larger range of concrete strengths, the correlation procedure becomes complicated. This where co-relation can Such relationships are more reliable if both pullout test specimens and compressive strength test specimens are of similar size, consolidated to similar density, and cured under similar conditions and same age of concrete. 20. PERMEABILITY TEST This test is used to determine the permeability of concrete in-situ, or concrete specimens either cast in the laboratory or obtained by extracting cores from existing structures. Permeability is a property that governs the rate of flow of fluid into a porous solid. In case of concrete, it can be used to characterize its transport properties that link to its durability. Depending on the mechanism of movement of fluids in to concrete, the transport processes are classified into three categories, namely, i. Absorption - movement of fluid due to capillary forces created inside the capillary forces. ii. Permeation - movement of fluid due to action of pressure. iii. Diffusion/migration - movement of fluid due to concentration gradient, with or without an applied electrical field. It may be noted that the above mechanisms may be acting on concrete structures together or separately on different occasions, depending on exposure conditions. Test methods, suitable for in-situ testing or for testing on specimen extracted from the structure, or on laboratory cast specimen for evaluation of different concrete mixes, have been developed to assess the permeability of concrete to fluids (air, water or chlorides) based on the above mechanisms. Generally, the air permeability test is carried out first and then the water permeability test is done on the same specimen. However, not all methods have been adopted as standard test procedures.

Air permeability Determination of air permeability of concrete is useful to assess its state of compaction, presence of bleed voids and channels, and the degree of interconnectedness of the pore structure. It is determined either in terms of time over which a pressure applied to a concrete surface of known surface area decreases by a certain value, or increase in pressure over a concrete surface of known surface area on which vacuum was created previously, or in terms of suitable units. Good correlation between Oxygen Permeability Index (OPI) values recorded at 28 days and carbonation depths after natural exposure were reported. Water Permeability Water permeability of concrete is measured as a flow of water under a constant or decreasing pressure gradient through concrete. This property is of great importance when an assessment of hydro structures, reservoirs or any other civil engineering structure such as sub-structures in bridges etc. that are in direct contact with water is carried out. Structures exposed to harsh environmental conditions also require low porosity as well as permeability. Instruments for testing water permeability on-site usually consist of a reservoir filled with water, which is connected to the concrete surface, a syringe or vacuum pump for introducing pressure into the reservoir and a transducer for monitoring pressure. Most of the laboratory methods consist of subjecting a mortar or concrete specimen of known dimensions, contained in a specially designed cell, to a known hydrostatic pressure from one side, measuring the quantity of water percolating through it during a given interval of time and computing the coefficient of permeability. The test permits measurement of the water entering the specimen as well as that leaving it. ####'),\n",

Many of the methods mentioned above are developed to be simple. Although the in-situ tests require minimum surface preparation, some of the laboratory methods need conditioning of the specimen. While some tests are completed in 10-15 minutes after preparation and condition, other tests need longer times from 1-3 days, or more. The methods do not measure permeability directly but provide res a ‘Permeability Index’ or permeability coefficient, or sometimes, which is related closely to the method of measurement. Most of these methods measure the permeability or porosity of the surface layer of concrete and not the intrinsic permeability of the core of the concrete. For the ISAT, tests on oven dried specimens give reasonably consistent results but in other cases results are less reliable encountered with in situ use in achieving a watertight fixing. The test has been found to be very sensitive to changes in quality and to correlate with observed weathering behaviour. 21.

This test is based on the principle that the force required to pull out a cone of steel embedded in concrete is proportional to the strength of concrete (Fig. A25). The insert is either cast into fresh concrete or installed in hardened concrete. The measured pull-out strength is indicative of the strength of concrete within the region represented by the conic frustum defined by the insert head and bearing ring. The pull-out strengths are indicative of the quality of the outer zone of concrete members and can be of benefit in evaluating the cover zone of reinforced concrete members. In short the procedure is as under: Inserts are placed at the location of tests. Such inserts are fixed to the location with bolts or proper fastening methods. The selected test surface shall be flat for drilling the core and undercutting the groove. Drill a core hole perpendicular to the surface to provide a reference point for subsequent operations. Use the expansion tool to position the expandable insert into the groove and expand the insert to its proper size. Place the bearing ring around the pullout insert shaft, connect the pullout shaft to the hydraulic ram, and tighten the pullout assembly snugly against the bearing surface, checking to see that the bearing ring is centered around the shaft and flush against the concrete. Apply load at a uniform rate so that the nominal normal stress on the assumed conical fracture surface increases. Record the maximum gage reading to the nearest half of the least division on the dial. It is to be borne in mind that levelling, curing period of grout in hole may affect the results. Fig. A25 Pull-Out Test Levelling, curing period of grout in hole may affect the results. For a given concrete and a given test apparatus, pullout strengths can be related to compressive strength test results. Such strength relationships are affected by the configuration of the embedded insert, bearing ring dimensions, depth of embedment and the type of aggregate (lightweight or normal weight).

TRANSIENT DYNAMIC RESPONSE TEST To locate delamination, cracking or loss of integrity in concrete the Transient Dynamic Response Test can be used. The test procedure uses the propagation of wave in a media to determine the impedance and mobility of the section. The mobility of section, frequency of the wave, area of cross section where the test is applied, length of wave propagation can be used to calculate the compressive strength of the concrete. In principle, for each step, the wave from an incident pulse travels through the section and is partly or wholly reflected at impedance changes within the member. If any of these returning reflections are in phase with the incident frequency, resonant makes the response of the section maximum. A graph of the maximum velocity against frequency of excitation would therefore show a series of resonating peaks with intervening troughs. This is the main principle on which TDR works is shown in Fig. A27 below: ####'),\n",

This impulse force is to be measured by means of a small electronic dynamic load cell. The response of the section to the hammer blow is to be measured by a velocity transducer (or geophone) held on the surface of the section. The force wave imparted onto the section and the resulting velocity response of the section are separately analyzed. The tests is carried out first by striking the surface and recording the reading as an average of best correlated three reading from the four reading taken. Test measurements may be presented either an equi-potential contour map or the cumulative frequency diagram, indicating the magnitude of affected area of the concrete member. Impedance at any given level in the section is therefore usually expressed by the relationship below: z = ρ.c.A where ρ is the density of the material used, c is the propagation velocity of the stress wave and A is the cross sectional area of the section. For slabs and pavements a diameter of 1000 mm. is be considered for the cross sectional area. It is imperative that the transmitter and the receiver are kept within this diameter. The results of this test could be affected due to traffic moving on the bridge. As any movement causes vibrations that will also be recorded by the geophone. One of the major advantage of this test is that it is rapid and if all sections are prepared a single team can test about a hundred sections. But this test cannot be performed on new concrete sections where the concrete is not fully set.

Experimental studies for assessment of stresses under biaxial stress condition can be carried out on ten specimens with different combination of loads.

This method has several disadvantages when compared to the incremental core-drilling method like (i) The strain gauge must be bonded to the structure in question and must stay bonded through the coring process, (ii) The strain gauge must be aligned with the direction of maximum principal stress.

The chemical reagents used for the testing are: (a) Nitric acid, relative density 1.4 (b) Silver nitrate standard solution, 0.1 mol/L (c) Thiocyanate standard solution, approx. 0.1 mol/L (d) Iron III indicator solution (Ammonium Ferric Sulphate solution added with 10 mL of nitric acid, (e) 3,5,5 - trimethylhexanol (nonyl alcohol). A powdered sample of concrete weighing 5 ± 0.005 g is taken into a stoppered 500 ml conical flask. 50 ml of water and 10 ml of nitric acid are added to the sample in the conical flask. 50 ml of hot water is added to the mixture and the mixture is boiled for 4 to 5 min. The mixture is kept warm for 10 min to 15 min and then allowed to cool to room temperature. The mixture is then filtered through an ashless filter paper into a flask and the remainder is washed with hot water. A measured excess of the silver nitrate standard solution is added into the beaker. Then, 2 to 3 ml of nonyl alcohol is added, the flask is stoppered and shaken vigorously to coagulate the precipitate. Then 1 ml of iron III indicator solution is added and titrated with the thiocyanate solution to the first permanent red colour. The acid soluble chloride content J of the concrete sample is calculated as a percentage of the cement to the nearest 0.01 % (m/m) from the expression: <table> <tbody> <tr><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr> </tbody> </table> 〈 〉 Where, M is the mass of sample used (in g); c V is the volume of 0.1M silver nitrate solution added (in mL); s V is the volume of thiocyanate solution used (in mL); 6 m is the molarity of the thiocyanate solution (in mol/L); C is the cement content of the sample used (in %). 1 Factors affecting the test results are: i. Loss of material, particularly dust, during the crushing and grinding operations should be minimized for better results. ii. Exposure to Atmospheric carbon dioxide. IS 14959 (Indian standard-Determination of water soluble and acid soluble chlorides in mortar and concrete — Method of test) also is based on titration and can be adopted. However, the sampling method is slightly different. Test method based on potentiometric principles using ion-selective electrodes are also available. They also may be adopted to determine the chloride content of concrete samples. Rapid test kits for in-situ chloride determination are also available and may be employed. However, in case of any dispute, the chemical method is taken as reference. ####'),\n",

In doing so, the Concessionaire shall take measures to overcome the physical and operational constraints and plan, design and construct the Project Highway using appropriate methods, management techniques and technologies. The objective, therefore is to construct a 4-lane highway for all road users as an active infrastructure facility for people for their safety and services and as a catalyst in development of economy based on an inclusive approach. General considerations shall, without being limited to, be as follows:- a) the Constraints The physical constraints in the existing highway are in the form of limitation of right of way, un-regulated access, inadequate service roads and underpasses, numerous at-grade junctions, lack of physical separation between local and through traffic etc. The operation constraints arise out of the necessity or possibility of closing a portion of the road for construction and/or diverting the traffic to temporary diversions, thereby reducing the capacity and safety of the existing highway. The solutions evolved by the Concessionaire shall be such that these operational constraints are overcome through appropriate planning, design and construction method, techniques and technologies and by adopting suitable traffic management measures. b) Safety of design All designs shall be safe to ensure that the Project Highway or any part thereof (for example embankment, pavement, retaining structures, bridges, culverts, etc.) does not collapse (global stability) nor its serviceability/performance (for example settlement, roughness, undulations, deflections, etc.) deteriorates below acceptable level as prescribed in Schedule ‘K’ of the Concession Agreement. c) Durability The Project Highway shall not only be safe but also durable.

Such an Interchange will be necessary at all crossings of a highway, which is to be developed to completely access controlled standards. An Interchange may also be justified at locations where traffic on cross roads is heavy and when an At-grade intersection fails to handle the heavy volume of turning, merging and diverging traffic leading to excessive delays and fatal and major accidents. ii) Cost effectiveness will decide whether to provide full Interchange or grade separated intersection without ramps. iii) An Interchange may be justified at the crossing of the Project Highway with another highway, and where the total traffic on all the arms of the intersection is in excess of 10,000 PCUs in peak hour. iv) The decision to provide Interchange at such locations shall be taken by the Authority and the requirement shall be clearly spelt out in Schedule ‘B’ of the Concession Agreement, which shall also indicate specifications and traffic streams to be grade separated. v) The detailed design and layout of the Interchange shall conform to broad parameters and requirements specified by the Authority in Schedule ‘B’ of the Concession Agreement.

The specific location shall be identified following the criteria given above and the type of crash attenuators will be based on severity of the situation and shall be indicated in Schedule ‘B’. 9.7 Safety Barriers There are two types of safety barriers viz., roadside safety barriers and median safety barriers. 9.7.1 Roadside safety barriers 9.7.1.1 There are three types of longitudinal roadside safety barriers viz: a) Metal beam safety barrier which is semi-rigid type like i) “W” beam type steel barrier and ii) Thrie beam type steel barrier b) Concrete Safety barrier- Rigid type c) Wire Rope safety barrier, Flexible type 9.7.1.2 The steel barriers with strong post type usually remain functional after moderate collisions, thereby eliminating the need for immediate repair. If damaged by a vehicle collision, both posts and rails of W-beam are to be repaired. Lack in maintenance can cause the W-beam rails to protrude into traffic way creating highly unsafe situation. The wire rope though technically complicated, can be repaired with minimum costs. Though initial installation cost is relatively high for concrete rigid barrier compare to W-beam and wire rope safety barriers, the repair and maintenance issues can be minimized greatly in concrete rigid barrier. The psychological shyness of drivers to keep away from the safety barrier will be the least in rigid concrete barrier compared to other types. Since rigid barriers will not yield under any vehicle impact, it shall be provided for bridges and ROBs and also to shield roadside objects/hazards where the required set back distance cannot be retained with wire rope and W-Beam (due to any site condition), as they are deflective in nature. 9.7.1.3 W-beam and Thrie beam perform well on the outside of curves and even those of relatively small radius. W beam is used when the design vehicle is not the truck. Thrie beam is used in location where barrier is likely to hit regularly, as Thrie beam rail make it less prone to damage. Thrie beam should be installed at locations there is a higher probability of heavy vehicles impacts, as higher rail increases the ability to contain heavy vehicles. 9.7.1.4 The warrants for roadside barriers are given below i) Embankment height 3 m or more shall have safety barrier at the edge of formation. The height of embankment for installation for safety barrier shall be measured from the top of finished road level to bottom level of Original Ground Level (OGL) or invert level of ditch. ii) Safety barrier shall be provided for all curves upto 450 m radii. iii) Roadside obstacles such as bridge piers, abutments and railing ends, roadside rock mass, culverts, pipes and headwalls, cut slopes, retaining walls, lighting supports, traffic signs and signal supports, trees and utility poles shall be protected with safety barrier. iv) Concrete barrier shall be provided at following situation ● Where embankment is retained by a retaining structure (concrete). ####'),\n",

For a safety barrier upon a structure, it shall be concrete rigid barrier. Wire Rope Safety Barrier shall not be used over major or minor bridges. vi) Steel barriers shall be provided in non-built-up sections whereas concrete barriers shall be provided in built-up sections vii) At hazardous locations identified in Schedule ‘C’ or through safety audit (concrete/steel as specified in Schedule ‘B’ or Safety Audit Report). viii) The requirements of Safety Barriers for structures are given in para 7.17 of this Manual 9.7.2 Road side steel barriers a) design aspects : The W-beam type safety barrier consists of steel posts and a 3 mm thick W-beam rail. There shall be a steel spacer block between the post and the beam to prevent the vehicle from snagging on the post, as the snagging can cause the vehicle to spin round. The steel posts and the blocking out spacer shall both be channel section of 75 mm x 150 mm size and 5 mm thick. The posts shall be spaced 2 m center to center. fig. 9.9 gives the typical details of W-beam rail and splices and shall be procured and installed from a reputed manufacturer. The Thrie beam safety barrier shall have posts and spacers similar to the ones mentioned above for W-beam type. The rail and splices design details for typical Thrie beam are shown in fig. 9.10 and shall be from a reputed manufacturer. This barrier has higher initial cost than the W-beam type but is less prone to damages to vehicle collisions especially for shallow angle impacts. The W-beam, the Thrie beam and the posts spacers and fasteners for steel barriers shall be galvanized by hot dip process and design elements and installations shall be as per the details shown for crash barrier in this manual so as to achieve the performance characteristics intended for W-beam. For any structural elements and details missing in this Manual for W-beam and its various end treatments, the details from international guidelines/manuals on W-beam which would conform to EN 1317 Part-2 can be adopted. b) End treatment for steel barrier: If hit, an untreated end of the roadside barrier can be hazardous, because the barrier beam can penetrate the passenger compartment and cause the impact vehicle to stop abruptly. End treatments should, therefore, form an integral part of safety barriers and the end treatment should not spear vault or roll a vehicle for head on or angled impacts. The end treatment on approach shall be Modified Eccentric Loader Terminal (MELT) arrangement as shown in fig. 9.11 and on departure side it shall be Trailing Terminal (TT) arrangement as shown in fig. 9.12. Following the same end treatments, fig. 9.13 present the typical layout of W-beam whether on raised median sides or on depressed/flushed median sides.

The final layout shall be as site-specific combination of these factors. Generally i) The slope in front of W-beam shall be near to flat gradient so that safety barrier perform best when impacted by a vehicle and the slope of ground in front of barrier shall not be steeper than 10:1. Metal beam safety barrier installed on shoulder side, there shall be a lateral distance of at least 0.75 to 1.0 m width from edge of paved portion (i.e. carriageway + paved shoulder) should be available without any obstacles. ii) On embankments, a minimum distance of 600 mm shall be maintained between the barrier and the start of embankment slope of a hazard to prevent the wheels from dropping over the edge. iii) Raised kerbs or drains shall not be provided between the traveled way and the barriers. These destabilize the vehicle balance and disturb its equilibrium before it strikes the barrier thus defeating the essential purpose of safety and redirection of the impacting vehicle. When a kerb exists on the edge of road and on close proximity of traffic lane whether on shoulder side or median side, face of W beam shall always be less than 100 mm from the vertical face of kerb. fig. 9.15 gives the lateral clearance to be maintained in different situations. iv) When metal beam is installed for shielding an object, minimum distance as specified by the manufacturer for deflection shall be maintained from the object/hazard. The distance between the barrier and the hazard shall not be less than the deflection of the barrier by an impact of a full sized vehicle. 9.7.3 Concrete roadside safety barriers a) design aspects: Roadside concrete safety barriers are rigid barriers having a sloped front face and a vertical back face. For uniformity New Jersey type concrete barriers should be used where necessary. The concrete barrier may be pre-cast in lengths of up to 6 m depending upon the feasibility of transport and lifting arrangements. Concrete grade for the barriers shall not be leaner than M 30. The minimum thickness of foundations shall be 25 mm thick cement concrete or hot mix asphalt placed at the base of barrier to provide lateral restraint. Where more than 75 mm thick over lay on the road pavement is anticipated, the foundation step may be increased to 125 mm. However, longitudinal roadside concrete barrier should have elaborate footing design which is structurally safe unless sufficient earth support is available. Precast concrete barriers shall be properly anchored in cast in situ footing and entire assembly shall be check against sliding and overturning.

In structures with footpath, the rigid barrier is placed between traffic way and footpath to protect pedestrian from vehicle impact. The approach and departure end of rigid barrier shall be continued with Metal beam barrier for a suitable length to ensure the continuity of safety barrier. In order to ensure the continuity of pedestrian pathway, metal beam barrier installed as continuation of concrete barrier can be terminated with terminal end arrangement described for metal beam barrier and then it can be resumed leaving 2 m in between enabling pedestrian to change their position from one side of barrier to other side of barrier as pictorially depicted in fig 9.14. c) Placement: The exact layout of the barrier shall be made by the design engineer keeping in view the lateral offset of the barrier and site site-specific requirements. Generally. i) The slope in front of Rigid barrier shall be near to flat gradient so that safety barrier perform best when impacted by a vehicle and the slope of ground in front of barrier shall not be steeper than 10:1. ii) Raised kerbs or drains shall not be provided between the traveled way and the barriers.

Provision of a lift or escalator at the FOB to encourage pedestrian to use FOB. At locations where maintenance of lift and escalator can not be ensured, other grade separated pedestrian crossing should be explored. Pedestrian subway is more user friendly as the first action of pedestrian is to go down on the steps and would be encouraging also, as total efforts require to use subway compared to FOB is very less. 9.8.5.2 Half-subway (or depressed PUP) is an alternative solution, wherein main highway is raised by 1.5m, which can be achieved with a gentle grade and pedestrian has to go down in steps from Ground level by 1.5m only. Thus the sunlight and outward exposure would still be inside the half-subway, which will have headroom of 3m. Since the main highway is raised by 1.5m, it will not affect the visibility across the highway for the business establishments along the highway. Thus, the half-subway or depressed PUP should be considered as an alternative solution for grade-separated pedestrian crossing. 9.9 Work Zone traffic management Plans (WtmPs) The traffic diversion plan during construction shall be prepared as per IRC:SP:55 for the entire project highway. Separate traffic diversion plan shall be prepared for structures and CD works. Following suggested layouts presented in IRC:SP:55 are recommended for various construction scenarios.

The Authority shall specify the number of trees which are required to be planted by the Concessionaire as compensatory afforestation or otherwise in Schedule ‘C’ of Concession Agreement. In case the number of trees to be provided is not specified in Schedule ‘C’, the concessionaire shall not be required to plant trees. The Concessionaire shall also maintain the trees and shrubs in good condition during the Concession Period as per the maintenance schedule. The Guidelines given in this section shall be followed in Plantation of Trees and shrubs. 11.2 Design Considerations in Various Locations 11.2.1 Set-back distance of trees and other plantation Trees on the roadside shall be sufficiently away from the roadway so that they are not a hazard to road traffic or restrict the visibility. Most vulnerable locations in this regard are the inside of curves, medians, junction corners and cut slopes. Trees shall be placed at a minimum distance of 14 m from the centre line of the extreme traffic lane to provide recovery area for the vehicle that runs off the road. A second row of trees 6 m further away will also be planted wherever possible. Preferably the first row of trees shall consist of species with thick shade and other rows of vertical type providing thin shade. Expansion of the Project Highway to 6-lanes shall be taken into consideration while locating the trees so that land is free of trees when further widening takes place. In case future widening is not to be considered the same shall be specified in Schedule ‘D’ of Concession Agreement The distances for alternative rows of trees shall be reckoned from the nearest edge of the unidirectional carriageway. No plantation shall be allowed on the embankment slopes. 11.2.2 Set-back of trees on curves In plain terrain a stopping sight distance of 180 m corresponding to the design speed of 100 km per hour may be ensured on all curved sections of the Project Highway along the innermost lane. However, where there are site restrictions their requirement may be reduced to 130 m corresponding to the design speed of 80 km per hour as a special case. The existing trees and vegetation on the sides have to be suitably thinned/trimmed, or even removed if necessary and a regular programme of pruning of the offending trees shall be undertaken as part of the maintenance operations. In all cases, location of trees shall be checked to ensure that clear vision of all highway signs/signals is available at all times to the motorists. Also, the foliage or trees shall not come in the way of roadway lighting. In urban/built-up sections of the Project Highway, trees can be planted on the raised footpaths, provided the distance between the edge of the kerbs and the nearest edge of tree is not less than 2 m. 11.2.3 Vertical clearance of trees and other plantations For safe traffic operation, the vertical clearance available across the roadway shall be minimum 5 m.

Flowering plants and shrubs are eminently suited for the purpose. These shall be planted either in continuous rows or in the form of baffles. The height of shrubs shall be maintained at 1.5 m to cut-off the effect of traffic lights coming from the opposite direction. In the sections, where the width of median is less than 2.5 m, shrubs or flowery plants may be planted in between crash barriers or other means like metal/plastic strips shall be provided to cut off glare. The shape of shrubs and plants shall be suitably regulated so that there is no overgrowth either vertically or horizontally beyond the edge of the median. In the vicinity of road intersections and median openings, median plantation shall be avoided or restricted to low-growing varieties to ensure adequate visibility. 11.2.5 Spacing of avenue trees The spacing of avenue trees will depend on the type and growth characteristics of trees, requirement of maintenance, penetration of distant views, etc. A range of 10-15 m would meet the requirement for most varieties. 11.2.6 Choice of trees The following guidelines shall be kept in view while selecting the species of trees to be planted: i) Trees shall be selected with due regard to soil, rainfall, temperature and water level. ii) Trees which become very wide shall be avoided as their maintenance would cause interference with traffic flow. iii) The species must be capable of developing a straight and clean bole up to a height of 2.5 to 3.5 m from the ground level. iv) The selected trees shall, preferably, be fast growing and wind-firm. These shall not be thorny or drop too many leaves. v) The trees shall be deep rooted, as shallow roots injure pavements. vi) In urban areas, the species selected shall be of less spreading type, so that these do not interfere with overhead services, clear views of signs/signals, and efficiency of roadway lighting. 11.3 Landscape treatment A suitable landscape treatment with provision of foundations and coloured lighting so as to enhance the overall aesthetics duly designed by a qualified and experienced landscaping architect, shall be provided at grade separators, elevated sections, viaducts, traffic islands, toll plazas, bus bays, truck lay byes, rest areas, O&M centre, etc. The locations where landscape treatment is to be given shall be specified in Schedule ‘C’.

AN INTRODUCTION TO THE MANUAL 1.1 A Brief History of Road Safety Audit 1.1.1 Road safety audit began in the late 1980s when a Road Safety Engineering (RSE) team in a County in England began to question the number of newly built roads that were appearing in the County’s black spot list. With support from the County Surveyor, a policy was developed requiring all new road designs in the County to be checked and approved for Safety by the RSE team prior to construction. This checking process became formalized as Road Safety Audit (RSA) and the RSE team became the first road safety audit team. It can be said that RSA team applied their black spot investigation skills in a proactive way so as to eliminate safety concerns at the design stage. The term “road safety audit” came to be used then, and continues to be used today, to refer to a thorough and detailed examination of a road design from a road safety perspective. 1.1.2 Similar procedures and policies spread throughout other British road agencies and the first “road safety audit manual” was published by the Institution of Highways and Transportation (IHT) in late 1990 to guide and encourage this new process. The road safety audit process has expanded globally since then, beginning initially in countries such as Australia, New Zealand and Denmark, before spreading through Malaysia, South Africa, and Singapore including India. In 1992, AUSTROADS developed a set of guidelines for use within Australia and New Zealand. In other parts of the world, road agencies were actively working towards the implementation of road safety audit in their jurisdiction. In subsequent years, many more road agencies in Asia, Europe, North America and parts of the Middle East adopted the Road Safety Audit (RSA) process in ways that best suited their local needs. 1.2 Purpose of Road Safety Audit This Manual is aimed at the road authorities (decision makers), engineers, technicians, consultants, contractors, concessionaires concerned with road projects, irrespective of category of road or the area where they work. The application of safety principles in the provision, improvement and maintenance of roads as means of accident prevention can be established through road safety audit. Thus, the purpose of this audit is to ensure that road users would be exposed to minimal risks of accidents in both new roads and existing roads. 1.3 How to use this Manual 1.3.1 This manual has been prepared as an-easy-to-read guide for the road safety audit of new road designs and existing roads. It contains details about engaging an audit team and the road safety audit process that will assist the members of audit teams to undertake an audit. This manual is a valuable instructional tool for auditors and for project managers alike. 1.3.2 To assist with the learning task, this manual includes audit case studies from typical road projects. The case study reports are reduced in length for practical reasons but the important safety findings from each have been placed into a table of findings. The table is simple, easy to read and to understand. It gives a blank column for the Client to use to respond to each recommendation from the audit team. ####'),\n",

However, this manual does not present all the technical road safety engineering information that an auditor needs to keep in mind for the audit task.

It provides useful information for everyone with a responsibility for planning, designing, managing, constructing, operating or maintaining roads and highways. 2.1 The Road Safety Situation In India, out of the 4,64,650 road crashes, 1,47,913 fatalities and 4,70,975 injuries had resulted in the year 2017. In economic terms, the cost to the nation is an estimated 3 % of Gross Domestic Product (GDP). A majority of fatalities are in the age group of 18 to 45 years. There is need for coordinated action by all the key stakeholders to address this serious concern. Road Safety Audit on roads is one critical step in that direction. 2.2 How can Engineers Reduce Road Trauma? 2.2.1 The road safety problem involves three components - the human, the vehicle and the road. International research shows that the road plays a crucial role in road crashes. It is often stated in public discussions that more should be done to improve the behaviour of road users. There are also frequent calls for increased enforcement of the road rules. Both calls reflect the involvement of the human factor in road crashes. 2.2.2 The roads are also in need of safety improvements and across the country, there are instances of geometric deficiencies, inconsistent pavement markings, missing (or wrong) road signs, traffic signals not operational, inadequate attention to needs of the vulnerable road users. The community expects their roads to provide clear efficient traffic management and high levels of safety, as well as to withstand the weather conditions. Pedestrians and cyclists are often left to cross high speed roads without assistance, especially in case of highway passing through urban settlements and villages. If crashes occur due to design deficiencies, the community will pay a much higher price than the initial capital cost. The cost of serious and fatal crashes can end up costing much more over the life of a road project than the initial capital cost. 2.2.3 The engineers are not expected to “wash their hands” of the safety problems on the roads and highways. Engineers are an important part of the solution to the road safety problem. Examining how road projects cleared through the traditional system of engineering design and hence checking yields a clear answer to the question of why the road safety audit process is needed in all road authorities: Sometimes a new design may include standards inappropriate for the type of road. ● In some cases, outdated standards may be used in a design. ● Sometimes, the combination of various elements of the design may yield a result that ● is not the best in terms of safety. ● Compromises may be made between traffic carrying capacity and safety which lead to a lessening of safety in the finished road project. Sometimes changes are made during construction which does not fully consider ● operational safety factors. ####'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'IRC:SP:88-2019', 'page': 6}, page_content='2.2.4 Road safety audit seeks to take an overall view of safety in a road project. It highlights safety issues and makes recommendations to minimize the effect of each. Road safety audit will not necessarily make every new design totally “safe” but it does raise safety high on the decision making agenda and it does cause deliberate decisions to be made on the basis of carefully brought out road safety recommendations. The earlier in the design process that an audit is carried out, the easier and less costly it is to achieve change. Early auditing at planning and design stages can achieve better safety results and usually at a much lower remedial cost. 2.2.5 Road authorities may bear in mind that road safety audit is a more effective process if carried out early in the road design process. It is urged, therefore, to focus on design stage audits. 2.2.6 In the early years of auditing, some road authorities in some countries tried to “catch- up” with the problems on their existing networks by auditing important roads and highways as a matter of priority. They perceived the audit of an existing road to be the “easiest” stage of audit, the one stage that can be undertaken by existing staff who can use that experience to prepare for later design stage audits. Unfortunately, this practice has left a legacy of numerous audit reports recommending safety improvements that cannot be treated because of funding constraints. 2.2.7 This, in turn, has led to disillusionment about the entire road safety audit process. The staffs responsible for organizing those audits have questioned why they were carried out. The audits have not produced any real safety benefits for the road users - so why bother? 2.2.8 Another negative aspect caused by this primary focus on existing road audits has been the mistaken view amongst some engineers that road safety audits and hazardous road location (blackspot) investigations are identical. This is not so. 2.2.9 Road safety audits are proactive - they try to identify safety issues in a road design. The objective here is accident/crash prevention. 2.2.10 Road crash investigations are reactive - they examine known crash sites and use crash data to develop cost-effective countermeasures. The objective here is accident/crash reduction. 2.2.11 The same road safety engineering skills and experience are needed for each process, but it is important to recognize that they are different processes and they produce different deliverables. 2.2.12 Programmes to reduce road crashes on existing roads through systematic crash investigation programmes (commonly called blackspot programmes) are also vital in any road agency. Such programs have been shown to be cost-effective in reducing the frequency and/or severity of crashes at high crash frequency locations. 2.2.13 A safety-conscious road agency will therefore include both the blackspot investigation programme and the road safety audit process within its engineering department. Both of these are important and both produce positive road safety benefits to the community. To sum up, RSA is proactive, road crash investigation is reactive. 2.2.14 Noting these words of caution, road authorities may find that safety audit of existing roads can still hold positive benefits, especially as they rarely have complete crash data to guide ####'),\n",

By auditing a stretch of existing road, an experienced road safety audit team can identify locations of heightened risk and can recommend cost effective improvements to reduce that risk. 2.2.15 If any road authority elects to develop such a program, there is need to: ● Clearly define the stretch of the road to be audited and the types of risks/crashes that need attention (e.g. collisions with roadside hazards, or head-on collisions, or pedestrian crashes, or intersection crashes). Have an agreed budget available for the remedial work. Unlike many safety issues ● identified in design stage audits, which may cost little to change, improving safety issues on an existing road may involve significant cost! ● Ask the audit team to prioritize their findings (from highest to lowest) to provide guidance on where to spend programme budget. It is possible that the cost of the recommended remedial work may exceed the budget. 2.3 Prevention is Better than Cure Road safety audit is summarized with the statement “prevention is better than cure”. Road safety audit is a process of crash prevention – it aims to identify safety concerns in a road design in order for changes to be made while they “are still pencil lines on a piece of paper”. By making changes at the design stage, road safety can be built in to new road projects and the risk to the future users of that road can be minimized. 2.4 What is Road Safety Audit? 2.4.1 A road safety audit is “a formal, systematic and detailed examination of a road project by an independent and qualified team of auditors that leads to a report of the potential safety concerns in the project.” A formal examination of design would not permit a layout shown below causing unsafe and illegitimate movement. Such potential unsafe situations would be captured in a safety audit and can be modified before implementation. 2.4.2 It is a formal examination because the audit follows a set process that leads to a formal report which then becomes a part of the record of the whole road project. It is a detailed examination that requires time, knowledge, skill, judgment, depth and detail. 2.4.3 It requires a team of independent auditors, each of whom is detached from the design team and who are qualified and experienced in road safety engineering practices. Other professionals could also add inputs to an audit, but the main auditors shall invariably have engineering background. Having a team of auditors (rather than a sole auditor) provides a variety of experiences that increases the likelihood of a potential safety concern being detected. Two heads are better than one! 2.4.4 The outcome of a road safety audit is a road safety audit report that identifies road safety ####'),\n",

Responsibility to implement these recommendations remains with road authority. 2.4.5 A road safety audit assesses the safety of all road users including car drivers and passengers, pedestrians, bicyclists and motorcyclists, trucks, bus passengers and 3-wheelers and users of animal drawn vehicles. 2.4.6 Road safety audit is: A formal process (not just an informal check). ● Conducted by persons who are independent of the design. ● ● Conducted by persons with appropriate qualification, training and experience. ● An assessment of road safety issues in a road design, a Traffic Management Plan for road works, a newly completed road scheme, or it can be the identification of safety concerns on any existing road. 2.4.7 Just as Importantly, a Road Safety Audit is not: a check of compliance with standards. ● a substitute for regular design checks. ● a crash investigation. ● an opportunity to re-design a project which needs to be carried out separately. ● a name for a more detailed site inspection. ● a way of assessing or rating a project as good or bad. ● 2.4.8 A good road safety audit will be accomplished when: Focus is on road safety issues only. ● Keep relevant standards and guidelines in mind while remembering that audit is more ● than compliance check with standards.

Produce audit report promptly - usually within four weeks of the audit inspection. ● 2.4.9 Designers are expected to comply with standards but audit job is not to check that they have done this.

Undertaking a road safety audit can be described as a combination of art and science – the art of appreciating the needs of the future users of the road coupled with the science of sound engineering principles. 2.5 Objectives of Road Safety Audit 2.5.1 The main objective of road safety audit is to minimize the risk of crashes occurring on an existing road/a new road project and to minimize the severity of any crashes that do occur or are likely to occur. 2.5.2 There are other objectives too, including: To minimize the risk of crashes occurring on adjacent roads (especially at intersections). ● To recognize the importance of safety in road design so that the needs and perceptions ● of all road users are met, and to achieve a balance between needs where they may be in conflict. To reduce the long term costs of a new road project, bearing in mind that unsafe ● designs may be expensive (or at times even impossible) to correct at a later stage.

The first part of its work is a “desktop” audit of the drawings and design reports. 6 The audit team then moves to the next part of the audit - a detailed inspection of the site during day time and night time. The team gathers by shooting chainage-wise photographs of all the problematic locations and records its observations. In case chainage-wise information is not available (for example on urban roads); the identified safety concern can be linked with the adjacent landmark on the candidate road stretch. Also, if any good road safety measure is found to be practiced by the road authority during the audit, the same shall be noted and recorded as part of RSA. Further, the audit team is advised to recommend for replication of safe practices at similar such problematic locations in their RSA report. This will in turn help in boosting the morale and confidence of the concerned road authority towards proper upkeep of the road. 7 Back in the office, the audit team prepares the audit report. When it is written, checked and signed it is submitted to the Project Manager (either in person or electronically). 8 For large or sensitive projects, there may be a completion meeting in order for the stakeholders to discuss and clarify the key safety issues 9 A paper trail is a required outcome from an audit and the Project Manager/Road Authority is required to add to this by responding to each audit recommendation – clearly stating what actions will or will not take place. Reasons for not accepting any recommendation shall be recorded. 10 Thereafter, implement all agreed changes and recommendations. 2.7 Why is Road Safety Audit Necessary? 2.7.1 Planning, designing, constructing, operating, managing and maintaining roads and highways is a complex task. The engineers charged with this responsibility usually face a wide variety of competing constraints and issues as they progress with their work. 2.7.2 Typical constraints include: Land acquisition ● Project cost ● Standards and guidelines ● ● Traffic carrying capacity Environmental impacts ● ####'),\n",

But sometimes, compromises are made which can lead to an increase in crash risk. The road safety audit process is now available to input road safety engineering expertise into the design process. The road safety audit team is the group of specialists that injects safety into the road design and assists the road authority to create a road that is as safe as reasonably practical. 2.8 The Five Stages of Auditing a Road Project 2.8.1 There are five stages of a road project at which a road safety audit can be conducted. Stage 1 Feasibility Stage/Preliminary Design Stage 2.8.2 An audit on completion of the planning or feasibility study stage will examine features such as design standards, route choice and continuity with the existing adjacent network, horizontal and vertical alignments, cross sections and interchange/intersection layouts. Careful auditing at this early feasibility study stage can help to reduce the costs and lost time associated with changes that may otherwise be brought about during later audits. Stage 2 Detailed Design Stage 2.8.3 This audit stage occurs on completion of the detailed road design (the final DPR) but before the preparation of contract documents. Typical considerations include geometric layout, pavement markings, signals, lighting, road signs, intersection details, clearances to roadside objects (crash barriers/frangibility) and provision for vulnerable road users. Attention to detail at this design stage can do much to reduce the costs and disturbance associated with last minute changes that may otherwise be brought about with a pre-opening audit. Stage 3 Construction Stage 2.8.4 This stage of audit takes place during construction of the road works. It examines the ####'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'IRC:SP:88-2019', 'page': 12}, page_content='safety of the traffic management plans for each phase of construction for large road projects (i.e. before the works begin), and it also inspects the provisions for road safety at the road work site during the construction period. Typical issues examined include the provisions for pedestrian safety, advanced warning zones, adequate transition zone lengths, worker safety, effective numbers of reflective signs, safe delineation, credible speed limits, temporary crash barriers, lighting and diversions. Stage 4 Pre-Opening Stage 2.8.5 This audit involves a detailed inspection of the new road project immediately prior to its opening. Although most road projects are constructed “under traffic” there is a time just before the Contractor hands over the project when the project is almost complete and when a pre-opening stage audit is undertaken. The new road should be driven, ridden and walked (as appropriate) by the audit team to ensure that the safety needs of all road users are provided for. A night-time inspection is particularly important at this stage to check installation and visibility of signs, markings, delineation, lighting and any other night time/low light related issues. 2.8.6 The number of project stages at which audits are conducted usually varies according to the classification of the road, and the size of the project. For example, a major road project on an expressway or multilane highway may be audited at each of the project stages. For efficient use of limited resources, smaller projects on roads carrying low volume of traffic may be audited at one or two stages. Stage 5 Safety Audit of Existing Roads 2.8.7 The existing road may be a well-established road dating back decades or it may be a recently upgraded or rehabilitated road. The audit of existing road aims to ensure that the safety features of a road are compatible with the functional classification of the road. It also aims to identify any feature that may develop over time into a safety issue (such as a tree blocking sight lines at an intersection). 2.8.8 A number of the safety issues found in these audits should be readily addressed through simple and low cost maintenance practices (e.g. tree trimming, sign and line marking renewal, and roadside hazard issues). As such, there are benefits in having maintenance crews trained in road safety reviews so that they can apply their safety knowledge routinely during each shift. 2.8.9 These crews may not be independent of the existing road network, and they may not be able to look at the road through the eyes of a first time user, but they will be able to eliminate the more obvious safety concerns. 2.8.10 Another issue with safety audits of existing roads revolves around the use of crash data. Some auditors like to have access to the Police crash data for the road they are auditing. They say it helps them to understand some of the proven safety issues along the road. 2.8.11 Others argue that this can cause the audit team to focus too closely on the crash sites, possibly overlooking other high risk locations. Whichever option is adopted, the road authority should be very clear in its objectives. If it wants a crash investigation, use crash data together with the audit. ####'),\n",

The audit team should prioritize its findings according to those that can most readily and cost-effectively be treated. It makes easier for the road authority to undertake the recommended treatments as per available budget. 2.9 What Projects are to be Road Safety Audited? 2.9.1 All new road projects will benefit from having road safety audits undertaken during the design and construction stages. However, in recognition of the need to apply resources to where they can have maximum effect, road safety audits may be commissioned only at selected stages according to the cost of the road project or the classification of the road. 2.9.2 It is difficult to be too definitive about the types of road project most in need of an audit but, as a general rule, audit: any road project on a high speed road. ● ● any road project experiencing high volume of traffic and vulnerable road users. 2.9.3 Another question is about the number of stages of audit to undertake. In general, the larger the road project, the more stages of audit it should have. But remember that it is not the cost of the project that is important; it is the cost of the mistake! 2.9.4 Safety issues can occur even in minor road projects and if they go unresolved, deaths and injuries may result. Complying with the road safety audit policy (See Section 4.3 for a draft policy) of an organization is an important step forward. 2.9.5 Safety audit in respect of Rural Roads (Other District Roads and Village Roads) and Roads in Urban Areas may require some special considerations during the audit process. These are discussed briefly in Sections 2.12 and 2.13. 2.10 Key Groups involved in a Road Safety Audit - their Roles and Responsibilities 2.10.1 There are three key groups involved in the road safety audit process: The Client 2.10.2 The organization (road authority) that is responsible for the project and which is deemed to be the “owner” of the road on behalf of the government. The Project Manager is the day-to-day representative of the Client on technical matters. While the Client is usually a road authority, it can also be a private investor (concessionaire) for toll roads. However, even in such cases, the road authority being the final Client, will ultimately decide what is to be done (and not to be done) in the road project. Designers 2.10.3 A person but usually a team commissioned by the Project Manager for the Client or by the Concessionaire to design and develop the road project. The design team may be a part of the Client organization or may come from a separate consulting company. The designers provide a service to the Client by designing the new road within the stated constraints issued by the Client. ####'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'IRC:SP:88-2019', 'page': 14}, page_content='Audit team 2.10.4 A team of normally 2 persons who are qualified as road safety auditors and who are independent of the design and the proposal. The audit team is engaged by the Project Manager for the Client. While the audit team may come from the Client’s organization (provided the team members are clearly independent of the project) they are now increasingly from specialist consultancy companies. The audit team provides a service to the Client by finding safety problems in the design. 2.10.5 When preparing Terms of Reference for an audit, or engaging an audit team to undertake an audit, it is necessary to be clear about the interaction of these three key groups. There must be shared co-operation and a clear understanding that all groups are ultimately working to one goal. However, the audit team is charged with injecting road safety expertise into the project and there may be occasions when the other groups question what the auditors recommend. 2.10.6 On such occasions, the audit team should maintain its position and push for the most appropriate safety outcome regardless of where the opposition may come from. The audit team does not have to concern itself with other factors (such as funding, environmental issues, traffic carrying capacity). It is to be borne in mind that road safety audit team is the champion of the cause of road safety. The team members should be clear and firm in promoting the cause of safety. 2.10.7 At the same time, the audit team should recognize that the Client has the responsibility to weigh up all competing factors and to decide the way forward. The team should put forward its case for safety as clearly as possible but then leave the Client, Project Manager and the design team to decide what will be done. The audit team may be invited to provide additional safety advice during the Completion meeting or afterwards but the team must recognize the right of the Client to ultimately decide. 2.10.8 The main functions of the key players in the road safety audit are summarized in Table 2.1.

In some states, these roads have intermediate lane (5.5 m) or two-lane (7.0 m) wide carriageway. With development of rural roads, these roads are experiencing accelerated growth of traffic. One negative externality associated with this is increased potential for accidents. 2.12.2 As with other categories of roads, crashes on rural roads may be caused by one or a combination of several factors such as: (i) Road design: compromise on geometric design due to land constraints, lack of proper road signs, pavement markings and other traffic control devices, poor intersection ####'),\n",

(vi) Environment factors: Heavy rainfall, fog, snow, storm, etc. creating unsafe driving environment. 2.12.3 Checklist The checklist in Section 7.3 will be applicable for safety audit of rural roads also. 2.12.4 Safety Aspects in Rural Roads The road agencies responsible for rural roads need to ensure that safety engineering measures are embedded into the design during preparation of DPRs and estimates. 2.12.5 The following aspects for improving safety on these roads may be given due attention: (a) Road signs and pavement markings should be integral part of road construction and upgradation works. The signs should be retro-reflective and markings done with thermoplastic reflective paints. They will also require regular maintenance to serve the intended purpose. There should be no compromise whatsoever on this requirement in all rural road projects and programmes. (b) Where the existing geometrics of the road alignment are poor, efforts should be made to undertake spot improvements identifying such locations. In the meanwhile, appropriate cautionary and speed limit signs should be posted at such locations.

The term ‘Urban Road Segment’ refers to the length of road with control arrangements at both of its ends, i.e. the upstream and downstream intersections are controlled intersections. Conducting of Road Safety Audit (RSA) of urban roads wherein the interaction of Motorized Traffic (MT) would invariably occur with the Non-Motorized Traffic (NMT). Motorized Traffic primarily consists of buses, cars, two/three wheelers including electric rickshaws with different dimensions and horse power and a minor proportion of goods vehicles (tempos, trucks) share the available road space with NMT traffic which includes cyclists, cycle rickshaws as well as pedestrians [identified as (Vulnerable Road Users)] would have frequent interaction with mixed mode motorized traffic typically witnessed on roads. Therefore, the RSA should ideally aim at providing safer environs considering such issues. Recognizing the emphasis of the Ministry of Housing and Urban Affairs (MOHUA) as well as Urban Local Bodies (ULBs) to provide increased mobility on urban roads during the last two decades, these roads are experiencing accelerated growth of traffic. One negative externality associated with the above phenomenon is the increasing trend of number of road crashes, especially during the lean hours of traffic on urban centers / cities. It is seen that on the urban roads of the country, chainage details are invariably absent. In the absence of the same, it is recommended to refer the adjacent prominent locations on the road judiciously while preparing the RSA report. This would help the road owning authority to implement the suggested changes in a logical manner. 2.13.2 As witnessed on other categories of roads, the root causes for the incidences of road crashes on urban roads can be attributed to one or a combination of several factors such as: Road design: compromise on geometric design due to land or Right of Way (RoW) ● constraints, lack of proper road signs, pavement markings, poor intersection layout, poorly designed and ineffectively placed signalized junction, inadequate sight distance and absence of segregation of NMT from Motorized traffic. Road condition: Uneven and slippery road surface and pot holes. ● Geometry: Poor geometrics coupled with absence of associated road appurtenances ● at the diverging and merging locations of flyovers. Road users: Dangerous driving (excessive speed, excessive alcohol), fatigue, not ● wearing seat belt/helmets. Vehicles: Failure of brakes and steering systems, tyre burst, lighting system, night ● time conspicuity. Environment factors: Heavy rainfall, fog, snow, storm, etc. creating unsafe driving ● environment due to poor drainage system, inadequate lighting. 2.13.3 Checklist The checklist in Section 7.5 will be applicable for the conduct of safety audit on urban roads as well. ####'),\n",

The signs should be minimum of micro prismatic grade or better in terms of its retro-reflectivity properties and markings shall be done with thermoplastic retro reflective paints. They will also require regular maintenance to serve the intended purpose. There should be no compromise whatsoever on this requirement for all types of urban roads. (b) Where the existing geometrics of the road alignment are poor, efforts should be made to undertake spot improvements identifying such locations. It is essential to mention in the audit report that till such improvements are carried out, appropriate cautionary and speed limit signs should be posted at such locations.

CONDUCTING A ROAD SAFETY AUDIT - THE KEY STEPS 3.1 Road Safety Audit Process 3.1.1 Road safety audits are undertaken to identify safety concerns in a road design so that those who are responsible for delivering the road project can take these safety concerns into account and make the necessary amendments at an early time. 3.1.2 The road safety audit process has ten steps. For some small road projects, some of these ten steps may be brief, but the sequence of steps still applies. The 10-step process is illustrated in Table 3.1.

In some road authorities, decision to audit a project is based on the road hierarchy. Works on expressways or national highways and primary arterials are always audited and usually at several stages. Projects on other roads are likely to be audited at fewer stages. ####'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'IRC:SP:88-2019', 'page': 20}, page_content='3.2.2 A draft road safety audit policy (outlined in Section 4.3) is included in this manual to guide road authorities about the type of road projects that should be audited and the stages of audit that may be undertaken. This draft policy may help the road authority to establish an audit policy that suits the needs of the organization and road users. Any policy should be realistic and it will need to take into account the resources (human and financial) available to the road authority. It may be better to start small and work up. 3.2.3 Sometimes, in the absence of an audit policy, other criteria may be used to decide about auditing a road project, including: At what stages in planning, design and construction will the audit be most useful? ● (Generally, the design stage would prove the better!) ● Will this road project benefit from an audit? (The answer is almost always yes!) 3.3 Selecting the Road Safety Audit Team 3.3.1 The road safety audit process is quite straightforward, but the qualification, experience and skills necessary to undertake a successful and worthwhile audit are quite substantial and extensive. The audit team needs to be able to interpret technical drawings and design reports, looking for any possible negative (unsafe) features included and at the same time any positive (safe) features left out. 3.3.2 The audit team also needs to be able to communicate clearly the safety concerns it finds in a report to the Project Manager. Writing a technically competent, clear and yet concise audit report is an important requirement. The report should detail the findings of the audit to the Project Manager and the design team. If they cannot understand the safety concerns detected in the audit, there is a risk they may take decisions which could lead to either a waste of public funds or to unsafe outcomes for road users. 3.3.3 However, the most significant aspect of good auditors is their ability to “put themselves into the shoes of the future road users” of motorized and non-motorized vehicles and pedestrians. Thus, the auditor will be better positioned to interpret the drawings and design reports and to draw out the key safety concerns for the future. Good auditors “put themselves into the shoes of the future road users” 3.3.4 In order to improve the likelihood of engaging a good audit team, road authorities should make clear in the Terms of Reference that a road safety audit is to be performed by a team (minimum of two persons) that is experienced and expert in the process. 3.3.5 Successful road safety auditors will have qualification and experience in road safety engineering. This experience will be enhanced if the auditor also has an understanding of: ● Traffic engineering Road design and construction techniques ● Aptitude for crash investigation techniques. ● Road user behavior ● 3.3.6 There are many benefits of engaging an audit team of two persons to undertake the ####'),\n",

The main benefits include: Different perspectives of the same issue can be gained. This can arise from the ● diversity of background and from the different experiences of a team. ● Cross fertilization of ideas. When two professionals discuss safety issues in the office during the “desktop” audit or when on site, they help each other to develop clarity in their ideas and a wider view of the potential safety concerns in the project. More knowledge readily available on-site. If the audit team has members with different ● background, they can assist each other on technical issues. Two heads are better than one. A qualified and skilled audit team – with experience relevant to the size and stage of project being audited – is essential 3.3.7 The Project Manager appoints the audit team and also specifies the number of team members in the team. The Project Manager may decide to use the draft Terms of Reference (see Section 4.4) to clearly define the requirements for the audit. 3.3.8 Each audit team should be led by a Senior Road Safety Auditor, having adequate qualification and experience in road safety engineering. 3.3.9 The audit team leader is responsible for managing the audit, communicating with the Project Team and ensuring that the report is completed on time. The team leader is usually the most experienced member of the audit team and will provide technical guidance and leadership to the other team member. 3.3.10 In appointing the audit team, the authority may consider the following: Is the auditor independent of the project? ● Has the auditor attended an approved audit training programme? ● ● Has the auditor the necessary qualifications, experience and skills for this size and stage of project? Is the auditor able to see potential safety concerns from different road users’ points of ● view? 3.3.11 The first essential ingredient in any road safety qualification and audit team is road safety engineering experience. In addition, it is important to select member with relevant experience: is the project an expressway or a local street; is it an urban or a rural road project? What stage of audit is involved? One of the most critical elements in any road safety audit is the judgment, technical knowledge and skills of the audit team. There is no substitute for an experienced road safety audit team that understands the audit process and is able to foresee potential safety concerns. 3.3.12 How many people should be in an audit team? This depends on the size of the audit task. However, as a general rule, a team of two members may be considered for most audits. For minor projects on low volume roads in low speed locations, the team may comprise of one Senior Road Safety Auditor along with one Apprentice Auditor who is qualified civil engineer and trained in road safety. ####'),\n",

For other projects (large projects on national highways and expressways), there may be hundreds of drawings and a number of detailed reports for the audit team to examine. It does take time and resources to gather together all the current drawings and documents. The Project Manager and the design team should be aware of this and should keep this in view when commissioning an audit. 3.4.4 One of the first tasks for the audit team is to list all of the drawings and reports that have been given to it for the audit. This list becomes a part of the audit report. 3.5 Holding a Commencement Meeting 3.5.1 Commencement meetings enable the audit team leader to meet with the Project Manager and also the design manager. 3.5.2 Commencement meetings provide an opportunity to explain the audit process to the Project Manager and designers, and to reassure them (if needed) that the audit will help their project. Sometimes, especially during the early days of audit in a new organization, some Project Managers and designers may feel a little threatened by having an audit undertaken on their project. 3.5.3 After gaining experience with audits however, almost all Project Managers welcome the safety inputs their project can gain from audits. They start to see audits as the main opportunity to inject road safety expertise into their project. This is positive and beneficial to all. 3.5.4 The Commencement meeting is also a time for the designer to explain where compromises may have been made in the design.

The audit team will not be able to inspect the site under all traffic or weather conditions, so if particular conditions are important (e.g. traffic conditions during market days), the audit team should be advised. 3.5.6 As audits become more common, commencement meetings will become less significant. The audit Team Leader will receive the drawings attached to an email. 3.6 Checking the Drawings, Design Reports and Documents 3.6.1 This “desktop” audit involves reviewing the drawings design reports and other documents in the office before and after carrying out the inspections. 3.6.2 Take time to closely examine the drawings. Scribble on the drawings and reports as necessary, and mark issues to be more closely examined out on site. List the possible safety concerns to be checked on site, making use of the checklists as required. 3.6.3 When back in the office, the audit team uses the drawings and design reports again to double check for safety concerns now it knows more about the site and its traffic conditions. 3.6.4 The process of reviewing the documents and inspecting the site is repeated as required until the audit team is satisfied that it has identified all safety concerns that can reasonably be expected to be identified from the drawings. 3.7 Inspecting the Site 3.7.1 The location of the new road proposal is to be inspected - by the entire audit team - during day time and again at night time. 3.7.2 The inspection involves taking the drawings and reports of the proposal out to the site and inspecting the whole site – trying to imagine what the finished road project will look like and how it will operate. During the site inspection, the audit team should “put itself into the shoes of the future road users” of the road project. 3.7.3 While on site, take lots of photographs. A few of these can be used in the audit report, while the entire stock of photos can serve as historical record of the audit assignment. They can also help the audit team to remember a specific safety concern when back in the office writing the audit report. Keeping a record of observations and safety findings on-site can be a challenge. Pen and paper will work but is often hard to manage in hot, dusty, windy, humid or wet conditions. Experienced auditors now tend to record their observations verbally direct on to a digital recorder or a smart phone. These enable more detailed observations to be recorded and in a shorter time. They are easier to use on-site and they give a digital record that can be stored in a computer for possible historical use. 3.7.4 While inspecting the site, auditors need to anticipate whether different light (day and night) conditions or weather (fog, rain) conditions may create safety concerns on the completed road. The team is expected to look beyond the limits of the project and to include adjacent sections of road in the audit. Transition zones, where the new road merges into the existing road system can often become locations of increased risk. It is not uncommon for additional delineation to be recommended in the “old section” of highway by the audit team as a way of transitioning road users safely from the new to the existing road. ####'),\n",

Auditors usually don’t know about the project constraints - if they become too prescriptive, they may prescribe impractical remedies to a safety concern, and in turn may end up losing credibility. For example, during a design stage audit, an audit team discovers a steep side slope beside a national highway. The slope will clearly be undrivable, it will be within the clear zone and it will clearly be a safety concern. The drawings do not show any action proposed for this location. Identifying and reporting the safety concern is the first and most important thing for the audit team to do. Being too specific with a recommendation when there are several options available can lead to difficulties. In this case, recommending to the Project Manager to “Install crash barrier” will often be seen as too prescriptive, and in some situations, it may not be the technically sound recommendation due to issues that are not known to the audit team.

The meeting provides an opportunity for the auditor, the Project Manager and the design team to discuss all and any issues in the report. This will usually involve a discussion of each safety concern, its risk rating and priority and its recommended ways to overcome the identified safety problem. 3.9.3 The meeting should be held in a professional and co-operative manner with a spirit of all parties working together for the enhanced safety of road users. It should not become a meeting of blame game, or serious dispute. A safety audit is a positive activity that helps to improve road safety for all road users by highlighting potential safety concerns before they become problems. 3.9.4 A Project Manager may ask for an audit report to be altered or to have some safety concerns removed. This happens rarely and it is neither professional nor ethical. In such cases, the Team Leader must not entertain any suggestion of altering a report to “soften” the audit findings. 3.9.5 The Project Manager is required to provide his response in writing to each and every recommendation in the report.

How does the client decide whether or not to accept an audit recommendation? It is neither always possible nor practical to agree with all recommendations as some of these may involve large additional expenses that will affect progress with the project.

It provides useful information to help to get road safety audit started in an organization, as well as information about developing a road safety audit policy for an organization. Essential information for those responsible for commissioning road safety audits is provided. Road safety audit is a process that road authorities should embrace as part of an overall strategic approach to road safety. However, for those road authorities with comparatively less experience with road safety audits, there may be some uncertainty about how best to go about implementing the process into their planning/design/construction programs. This Section provides some guidance and advice for decision makers, managers, engineers and staff of road authorities. It offers special assistance to those who are responsible for implementing the road safety audit process within their organization, or who are required to engage consultants or safety auditors to carry out safety audits of their road projects. 4.1 Putting Road Safety Audit to Work in the Road Authority For those road authorities yet to introduce the road safety audit process into their road planning/ design/construction process, the following points provide guidance about the way forward: Whether there is a formal commitment to improving road safety and this kind of support ● and empowerment is critical to creating a “safety culture” within a road authority. Include road safety in the Action Plan of organization, and commit to developing a ● Road Safety Action Plan. Develop a Road Safety Action Plan. Base it on relevant road safety strategies (such ● as existing national and state road safety strategies). There is need to include a programme for the treatment of hazardous road locations (a blackspot programme) as well as the road safety audit process. Hold an open meeting of senior technical staff to discuss and address the important ● road safety audit issues that will arise in the organization. In so doing, develop an audit policy and a set of basic audit practices which meet the needs of organization. Points that may arise in that meeting include: \\uf0e3 How will the organization get adequate road safety audit skills and resources? \\uf0e3 What needs to be done for the audit process to be understood by senior executives, managers, designers and potential auditors? \\uf0e3 Designers may initially express reluctance at having their work audited. How can this be addressed? \\uf0e3 How much training is required and for whom (departmental manager, engineers, designers, potential auditors)? \\uf0e3 What road projects are to be audited in the organization? Only the largest projects, or only those on the busiest roads, or maybe urban only, or perhaps all projects above a certain cost or length. ####'),\n",

Who will decide to accept or reject the more “difficult” recommendations? A formal process is required. \\uf0e3 How will audit findings be fed back into the design process to improve future designs? ● Get started. Consider calling in a team of qualified and experienced road safety auditors to undertake some pilot projects of road designs. Use their findings in a training workshop that includes managers, designers and potential future auditors as participants. Practical examples are very convincing. Designers and Project Managers of the road authorities quickly become audit supporters when they see for themselves some of the safety issues that arise in some road designs. Adhere to the agreed road safety audit policy to improve designs before they are ● built. Get feedback from auditors, designers and managers and then modify the audit policy and the audit process to best suit the road authority as experience grows. Be prepared for some mistakes but take time to learn from those mistakes so that ● the road safety audit process can develop and grow in the organization. After gaining experience with design stage audits, consider undertaking safety audits of the existing road network (possibly in conjunction with a program of treating hazardous road locations). Let the senior executives know how the audit process is progressing in the organization. ● Give them examples of where road users have benefited because of the road safety improvements generated through the audit process, and let them know how staff members are learning new skills as a result of the process. ● Keep it going! Once road safety audit becomes established in the organization there can be a temptation to believe that it will happen automatically. This may or may not be so. Monitor the quality and the quantity of audit reports. Maintain a training and awareness program. Ensure that road safety audit is promoted with continued energy and passion. 4.2 Options for having a Road Safety Audit undertaken 4.2.1 The road authority for a road project is responsible for appointing a Project Manager to oversee the project on its behalf. There are three key attributes that the Project Manager should ensure when engaging a team of road safety auditors. The audit team should be: ● Qualified – satisfy the requirements laid down for a Senior Road Safety Auditor/ Auditor. ####'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'IRC:SP:88-2019', 'page': 31}, page_content='● Experienced – demonstrated experience with the type of road project and the stage of audit. ● Independent – clearly have no previous involvement in the planning or design of the road project. 4.2.2 Without a qualified and experienced audit team, the road authority may end up with an audit report that fails to add value to the project. If the team is not fully independent of the project, they could be too forgiving of some of the safety issues involved because they know of the design constraints that have led to them. Independence is important for the fresh identification of safety issues, as well as to ward off possible accusations of “soft” audits. 4.2.3 With these key attributes in mind, the main options for getting audits done are: ● Engage an independent consultancy firm – have the Project Manager engage an experienced consultancy firm to do the audit. This option ensures that the audit is independent, and over time may lead to a competitive market in providing audit services to road authorities. A sample Terms of Reference for a road safety audit is given in Section 4.4. Use in-house staff – this option has the advantage that it is quick and easy to arrange, ● and it can mean that the auditors can see the scheme through to completion. It is necessary to ensure that the staff used are trained and experienced in road safety audit and are independent of the design. By adding to their practical audit experience, the in-house staff can develop their awareness of the audit process and they may therefore be more discerning when obtaining audits in the future. 4.3 A suggested Road Safety Audit Policy 4.3.1 There is a need for all staff in a road authority to be clear about what road projects are to be audited and at what stages this should be done. It is equally important to ensure that road safety audit becomes firmly established in a road authority. 4.3.2 Both of these needs are best satisfied by formulating a road safety audit policy by the authority. 4.3.3 Such a policy should detail the type of road project to be audited, the stage(s) of audit that will be undertaken and the reporting and response systems. The policy should be disseminated widely to all professionals in the road authority, as well as to all professionals who have dealings with the authority on road and safety related matters. 4.3.4 An example of a draft road safety audit policy for the road authority is given below. It is to be remembered that any policy (whether about road safety audits or any other subject) should be a “living” document. It should be reviewed and updated as experience with the process grows within the road authority. “Road projects to be undertaken by the [insert name of road authority] will be road safety audited at the following stages (refer Table 4.1) according to the class of the road, in accordance with the procedures contained in IRC:SP:88 titled, “Manual on Road Safety Audit”: ####'),\n",

PRACTICES FOR SAFER ROADS A member of a road safety audit requires examining project drawings, inspecting the site and making decisions about what may be potentially unsafe in the drawings, at the worksite or on the finished road. He/she is expected to understand the audit process, and to be knowledgeable in the field of road safety engineering. He is expected to exercise sound judgement in determining what might, and what might not, be a road safety concern when the project is built. Auditors therefore need to be knowledgeable and experienced in most, if not all, aspects of the road safety engineering profession. 5.1 Starting your Audit 5.1.1 When you set out to conduct an audit, ask yourself a few simple questions about the drawings: ● Is the proposed cross section suitably safe for the road classification? Do the horizontal and vertical alignments suggest any features that may warrant ● special consideration? Will the new road be easily understood by the road users (motorised and non- ● motorised)? Do any parts of the design present direct risk to any group of future road users? ● Are any roadside hazards obvious? ● Has enough been done to assist the safety of vulnerable road users – moving along ● as well as across the new road? Will weather conditions present safety issues for the new road? Will the new road be ● safe at night? If any of these trigger a potential safety concern in your mind, start to think about what ● may be possible to alter in the design now in a positive manner to improve safety? After these questions you will begin to go into more and more detail. The checklists ● (See Section 7) are provided to help and guide and remind you of some of the safety issues to look out for. 5.1.2 Remember the general aim of an audit is to produce a new road that is as safe as reasonably practical. Ask yourself, will the new road: Warn ● Inform ● Guide ● Control ● Forgive ● 5.1.3 From experience with road safety audits, a few common safety concerns emerge frequently. In order to promote safety for all road users and to raise awareness of these common safety concerns, the following sections give some brief advice on the safest way forward. ####'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'IRC:SP:88-2019', 'page': 37}, page_content='Vulnerable Road Users 5.1.4 The country has a mix of traffic that is perhaps unique in the world. Pedestrians, bicyclists, motorcyclists, rickshaws and animal drawn carts mix with cars, trucks buses and countless other vehicles at all times of day and night. This presents special challenges for road designers and road safety auditors. 5.1.5 One of the most important things that the member of an audit team can do is to put himself into the shoes of the vulnerable road user. You should walk the site, ride a bicycle through the site, maybe use a rickshaw at the site and try to foresee the special safety needs of these large groups of road users. 5.1.6 Many safety enhancements can be made to help these groups. Mostly they start with an appreciation of the real needs of the users and a general principle not to impose restrictions on their mobility. Such actions are rarely successful. Instead, try to work with these road users and provide simple low cost enhancements that can assist their mobility and their safety. Night Time Visibility 5.1.7 Roads are used both day and night, and so they should be inspected during night time as well as day time. Some locations look very different at night; they may or may not have street lighting. Some street lighting can create visual deceit. Older people generally have poorer eyesight and this makes reading road signs more difficult than it is for younger people. This is made worse after dark, so particular attention should be paid to night time conspicuity and visibility for the elderly. Perception of widths and distances by older drivers also becomes more difficult at night time. Visual Deceit 5.1.8 At some locations, visual cues along a road may give the wrong message to a small number of drivers/riders. A long row of trees, or power lines, can give an impression that the road continues straight. Then, if the road takes a bend, some drivers will be misled by the trees or the power poles and may proceed in the wrong direction. This can occur regardless of the number of warning or guide signs telling them otherwise. This “visual deceit” can be strong; audit teams need to consider it and report on it as and when necessary. ####'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'IRC:SP:88-2019', 'page': 38}, page_content='Speed Management 5.1.9 High speed is a major contributor in serious crashes. Auditors should check the drawings to ensure that the operating speeds of the new road can be managed within levels that are appropriate for the design speed of the road. 5.1.10 Firstly, ensure that the design speed and the likely operating speeds match each other. Otherwise some drivers may be caught by surprise at curves. 5.1.11 Secondly, be satisfied that there will be a suitable speed limit imposed. This will need adequate speed restriction signs along the route to remind drivers/riders of the speed limit. 5.1.12 Thirdly, consider the need to reduce operating speeds through “self-enforcing” measures such as traffic calming in towns and villages (such as gateway treatments, raised crossings, road narrowing) or by speed enforcement (such as speed cameras). 5.2 Technical Tips for Audit Teams: Warn, Inform, Guide, Control and Forgive During every audit you should ask these basic questions – will the future road users be warned, informed, guided, controlled and forgiven on the new road? The answers you get will help your audit. \\uf033 Warn Warnings can be given by signs, pavement markings or rumble strips. The message should be clear and simple. Will more warnings be necessary on the new road? \\uf033 Inform Information is best provided in small amounts, and drivers are not overloaded with too many destination names to be read and take action on high speed to take decision on approaches to junction. Direction signs and lane direction arrows are examples of providing necessary information to drivers/riders. Does the design show enough information for safety and fonts are bigger enough to be read by driver on approach speed?

This occurs often at road work diversions and at sharp curves on hill roads. There must be no surprises on roads. Do the road works, or does the design for the new road, need additional devices to guide the future road users? \\uf033 Control Safe control of intersections is a necessary part of a safe road network. If two roads are intersecting, both having comparable traffic volume uncontrolled T intersection would be unsafe, where roundabout would be a safe traffic control. Does the design have other additional traffic control devices for safety?

A combination of good geometrical design, good information for drivers and good maintenance of the road is needed. An early stage of audit (such as planning/feasibility) can focus on geometric design and sealed shoulders to minimize run-off-road risk. In later audits, other safety options to reduce run-off-road crashes such as tactile edge lines, warning signs, guideposts and chevron alignment markers should be questioned if not shown in the drawings. 2 Remove fixed objects from the clear zone What clear zone has been used in the design? Is it appropriate? What fixed objects (defined as those with a diameter of 100mm or greater) remain in the clear zone? They should be removed, if possible. 3 Relocate hazards from the roadside (to a position outside the “clear zone”) If it is not possible to remove a fixed object from the clear zone, the next option is to relocate it further off the road. Is this feasible? Experience and judgement is necessary in such cases and the actions in Steps 4 and/or 5 may be brought in at this point. For example, a lighting column pole may be able to be relocated 8 metres further from the road, but it will be less effective in lighting the road from there. The team may recommend a 4m relocation and a slip based lighting column as a safer option. 4 Alter the hazard to reduce the severity of a collision Safer forms of road furniture now exist. Large signs can be placed on “weakened” sign posts. Frangible lighting columns are available (slip based or impact absorbent) to absorb the energy of an impacting vehicle and reduce injuries. Drivable end walls for culverts can reduce injuries. 5 Install crash barrier to shield errant vehicles from the hazard When the first four steps in the strategy have been exhausted, the installation of crash barriers may be the only remaining option. The purpose of crash barriers is to protect the humans who are inside an errant vehicle from striking a more serious roadside hazard. Audit teams should understand that even a crash barrier is a fixed object, and can cause injury when struck. If used, the audit team will need to check they are correctly designed and installed in accordance with IRC:119. Safe end terminals are important. Traffic attenuators can be provided to shield a hazard at gore area i.e. traffic bifurcation location, complying general criteria for provision given in IRC:SP:87, IRC:84 and IRC:SP:99 respectively for 6 lane, 4 lane and Expressway Manual. ####'),\n",

However, barrier should only be installed when the severity of a crash with a hazard will be greater than a crash with the barrier itself. Crash barriers are roadside hazards; they can be especially dangerous if they are not correctly designed and installed. Therefore, after assessing that barrier is required, auditors should check that the correct type has been selected and that it has been designed correctly? 5.4.2.2 Auditors should look closely at the standard drawings for the barrier details. The correct design and installation of crash barrier is a skilled task. Audit teams may need to refer to technical guidelines in IRC for more information. Some may even decide to add an additional expert on the team to assist in deliberations about the crash barrier. 5.4.2.3 Crash barrier shall be long enough to fully shield the hazard. Short lengths of barrier are a common safety concern in audit reports! 5.4.2.4 Lateral placement of the barrier is very critical. It shall be such that a bumper of an errant vehicle hits crash barrier before its wheel touches, if at all kerb has been provided. Also, barrier shall be sufficiently offset from the hazard sufficiently to accommodate deflection of the barrier? If at all the barrier is installed some distance from paved edge, the distance between paved edge and barrier shall be uniformly grade not more 1:10 slope and kept intact. 5.4.2.5 Ensure that the barrier height, overlap of the metal beam, orientation of posts is correct as per standard and safe end terminal have been provided. 5.4.2.6 Removing a hazard is the best option for an audit early enough in the DPR process. 5.5 Technical Tips for Auditors: Road Signs & Pavement Markings 5.5.1 Avoid using signs as a quick or cheap “fix” to all safety issues. They may be an acceptable solution to some safety issues; however, you should discuss whether or not a sign is the best solution to a problem. If you decide to recommend the use of a sign it is necessary to remember the basic principles of good signing, and then check for these in later stage audits. ####'),\n",

Hence, hazardous marking shown for 100 to 200m ahead of reduced width will be a solution, as detailed in IRC:35. \\uf033 Marking that affects Users’ Behavior Physical island enveloped by marked island would be a safer practice, wherein the physical island is set back in line with edge of paved shoulder. This will prevent island hit accident if a vehicle attempts to move forward using the paved shoulder. The width of the slip lane can be marked in such a way that two vehicles would not run parallel while turning. As a result the marked island will be much larger than the physical island and island would be much conspicuous. 5.6 Technical Tips for Auditors: Pedestrians Pedestrians are the largest and most vulnerable group of road users. Use signalised crossings to give pedestrians time separation from vehicles to cross busy roads. Use medians or refuges to give them spatial separation from vehicles. Overpasses/subways are not popular and should only be used as a “last resort” to segregate pedestrians and vehicles on roads with high speeds and high traffic volumes. ####'),\n",

In the Shoes of the Pedestrian The audit team should walk the site (day and night) to check for pedestrian issues. Pedestrians need to be able to clearly see where they should go. While this may be clear to engineers on a plan, it is not always obvious on the ground. Footpaths Footpaths are desirable to provide pedestrians with their own space on which to walk, especially in urban areas. Auditors should check to ensure they are wide enough for the expected volumes, and are continuous. Wherever gaps are unavoidable, proper ramps should be provided to cater for elderly and differently abled people. In later audit stages, they should check that kerb crossings are provided and the footpaths are clear of obstacles. ####'),\n",

The main audit findings are summarized and are presented in a standard format. The layout of these audit reports, including the tabular presentation of the audit findings, is suggested to be a useful template for use in road safety audit reports. To have uniformity, the issues are arranged in the order as in the checklist. It also allows space for the Project Manager to provide response to each recommendation. Four case studies showcase some of the safety concerns that typically arise at different stages of audit and on different types of road projects. The focus in these case studies is on design stage, construction stage, pre-opening stage audits including existing road audit. The four case studies show audits of different road projects. One of the projects is audited at two stages (DPR and pre-opening) to show the relative differences in the typical safety concerns that might be identified in an early versus a later stage of audit. 6.1 Case Study 1: DPR Stage Audit 6.1.1 The project corridor taken up for rehabilitation and widening of a state highway between km 86.0 and km 142.0 has been subjected to road safety audit by reviewing the Detailed Project Report (DPR) and drawings of the above project corridor by a two member RSA team. 6.1.2 Audit Team Two team members including a Senior Road Safety Auditor have been involved in the above RSA. 6.1.3 Project Background A 56 km section of two-lane two-way state highway is to be rehabilitated and widened. This section of highway commences in a flat area of rural land and is basically straight and flat for the first half until it reaches a wooded hill area for the second 28 km. The road is presently 6m wide (2 x 3m lanes) with unsealed 1m wide shoulders along both sides. The proposal shows a 7m wide pavement (2 x 3.5m wide lanes) and unsealed 1.5m wide shoulders on both sides. An 80km/h design speed has been used for the flat section and a 50km/h design speed has been used in the hill section. The highway passes through two towns and eight villages. Ten new bus lay-bys are included in the proposal. No change is proposed to the six existing bridges. 6.1.4 Audit Details The road authority requests a road safety audit of the DPR. The Project Manager selects a road safety audit team and provides him with the ToRs for the audit. The senior auditor, on viewing the size and stage of the project, invites a colleague to join him in the audit team. 6.1.5 The Project Manager has the design team which provided the audit team with a complete set of the latest drawings, as well as the design report prepared for the project corridor. 6.1.6 The team then travels to the location of the proposed highway rehabilitation; they inspect the entire length during day and night. The audit team also inspects the highway for a few kilometres outside the 56km long section in order to check that those nearby areas won’t become high risk locations after the work is finished and traffic speeds increase. 6.1.7 Format of a road safety audit report is presented in the prescribed template. All the titles of issues as listed in the checklist are reproduced to impress that all issues as in the checklist shall be verified and all issues shall be reported with exact location in the road safety audit of the given road. Being a sample report, only a few issues are picked up and shown below: ####'),\n",

Ideally, such types of construction stage RSA should be conducted at every 3 to 4 month interval till the project corridor is declared ready for pre-opening stage RSA by the audit team. After each of the construction stage RSA visits, compliance need to be submitted by the client to the audit team. 6.2.3 Project Background A 235 km section of a National Highway between two major regional cities is to be upgraded. One section (65 km) will be upgraded to become a 4-lane divided highway; the remainder will be widened to become a six lane divided highway. There will be 17 new flyovers and four new interchanges in this major road project. The Contractor has decided to reduce construction time by having up to 12 work sites underway at the same time. 6.2.4 Audit Details The road authority requests a road safety audit of the road works. The Project Manager decides to engage an audit team of three members as he considers that this highway improvement is a significant one that will benefit from a larger audit team. The Project Manager ensures the team size is made clear in the ToRs for the audit. 6.2.5 This is the first safety audit that has been conducted on this project. No design stage audits were conducted. The Project Manager therefore decides to hold a commencement meeting to discuss the project and the audit. 6.2.6 The audit team begins by undertaking a “desktop” audit of the traffic management plans for the construction work and subsequently carried out the audit. 6.2.7 Format of a road safety audit report is presented in the prescribed template.

       " Document(metadata={'source': 'IRC:SP:88-2019', 'page': 67}, page_content='6.3 Case Study 3 : Pre-opening Stage Audit 6.3.1 Pre-opening stage road safety audit of the rehabilitation and widening of the state highway between km 76.0 and km 142.0. 6.3.2 Audit Team A team of three members including a Senior Road Safety Auditor have been involved in the Pre-opening Stage RSA. Ideally, any road subjected to pre-opening stage RSA should have undergone audit starting from Design Stage RSA followed by Construction Stage RSA at every 3 to 4 month interval. It is expected all the pending safety issues pointed out in the previous stages of RSA as well as any other new minor safety related issues have to be addressed by the client as the RSA team would not suggest any major changes to the project corridor at this stage. This is because after the completion of Pre-Opening Stage RSA and the submission of compliance letter by the road owning agencies, the road would be opened to traffic operations. After the road is opened for traffic operations, it is also prudent to solicit the views of the road users by conducting the roadside questionnaire survey on the project corridor. This survey should focus primarily on any of the missing road safety issues, on the Project Corridor and the same should be conducted within 3 to 4 months from the start of normal traffic operations. 6.3.3 Project Background A 66 km section of road section comprises of 10 km of 4-lane divided bypass of an industrial town and remaining 56 km of two-lane two-way highway has been rehabilitated and widened. The highway commences in a flat rural area and leads into a hill area. The 4-lane divided carriageway comprises of 2 x 7.25 m wide carriageway with 1.5 m wide paved shoulder and 4.5 m wide median and 2-lane road section comprises of 7m wide pavement (2 x 3.5 m wide lanes) and unsealed 1.5 m wide shoulders on both sides. Km 76 to 86 of 4-lane section has not been audited in the design stage. But the km 86 to 142 km has been audited and as a result in the towns and villages, within one kilometer of each and on selected curves, the shoulders have been sealed as a result of the DPR stage audit recommendations. 6.3.4 Audit Details The road authority requests a road safety audit of the new work. The Project Manager decides to engage the same audit team which had previously (20 months earlier) audited the DPR drawings. 6.3.5 The audit team spends time inspecting the finished roads as well as the drawings to consider as what recommendations can be included even at this stage of pre-opening audit causing least disturbance to contract and time over run. They visited the site both during day and night and also received the “Good for Construction” drawings. 6.3.6 Format of a road safety audit report is presented in the prescribed template. All the titles of issues as listed in the checklist are reproduced to impress that all issues as in the checklist shall be verified and all issues shall be reported with exact location in the road safety audit of the given road. Being a sample report, only a few issues are picked up in the report and shown below. ####'),\n",

ROAD SAFETY AUDIT CHECKLISTS While engineers may be described as problem solvers, road safety auditors are best thought of as problem finders! To help them in their problem finding work, a set of checklists can be a useful memory jogger. 7.1 The Purpose of these Checklists 7.1.1 The following set of checklists has been developed for use in road safety audits. They include references to the typical road types and road projects that are common. The checklists remind audit teams to always consider the safety needs of the vulnerable road users (pedestrians, bicyclists, rickshaw pullers and three wheelers) in equal measure to the safety needs of motorised road users (car, truck and bus users). 7.1.2 Checklists are intended to reduce the risk that important safety concerns may be overlooked during an audit. However they cannot be a substitute for knowledge or for experience. The use of the checklists also requires sound judgement. 7.1.3 Checklists should therefore be considered as a list of reminders to help in audit. There are different road projects on different types of roads and in many varied topographical locations. Therefore these checklists may, or may not, be fully applicable to all road projects. Be prepared to expand each list as and when necessary. 7.1.4 These checklists are intended to be photocopied. It is recommended that the originals are kept intact for subsequent audits. The photocopies can be taken on site and used as necessary. The completed checklists are kept by the audit team for future reference. It is not necessary to attach completed checklists to an audit report or to pass them to the Client. 7.1.5 The road safety audit report is the necessary deliverable from an audit. 7.2 When and how to use the Checklists 7.2.1 There are five recognised stages of audit in India, including the road safety audit of existing roads. Checklists for each stage are contained in this Section. 7.2.2 It is suggested that the audit team leader uses the checklists as follows: Determine which checklist is needed, based on the stage of the project. ● Have the checklist(s) photocopied. Use the copy for the desktop audit and the site ● inspection. Remind team members that a successful audit is not achieved simply by just ticking ● off each item on the checklist. The topics in each checklist cover only the common elements of a road project; they are detailed but are not exhaustive. Remember too that some checklist items may not be relevant to the project being ● audited. Auditors need to therefore exercise their own judgement about the safety of any feature in the design of the project. This is where knowledge, experience and judgement are paramount. ####'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'IRC:SP:88-2019', 'page': 82}, page_content='Audit team members are encouraged to think broadly about the safety of the future ● road users of the road project and not to be restricted only to items on the checklists. The checklists have been so worded that a negative answer (NO) to any question ● means that there is a safety issue that may need to be included in the audit report. A positive (YES) answer given to any question means that issue has been examined ● but is not considered likely to present a safety issue to the future road users. The NA (Not Applicable) column is provided for completeness as there will be many ● occasions when some items on the checklists are not relevant to the proposal being audited. Add notes in the Comments column as felt necessary to remind to alert the audit team ● where the safety issues are located and what they are. Some auditors may elect to use digital recorders or mobile phones to record their ● observations while on site. This is often easier than writing notes on the copies of the checklists and it can provide an opportunity for more details to be recorded in a shorter period of time. 7.3 The Road Safety Audit Checklists 7.3.1 Following Checklists are included: Table 7.1 Checklist for Planning/Feasibility Stage Table 7.2 Checklist for Detailed Design Stage Table 7.3 Checklist for Construction Stage Table 7.4 Checklist for Pre-opening Stage Table 7.5 Checklist for Audit of Existing Roads 7.3.2 A separate checklist for Detailed Design Stage Audit of Rural Roads (Refer Table 7.6) has been included for rural roads. ####'),\n",

INTRODUCTION Warm Mix Asphalt technology has been in use in USA and a number of European countries for several years. A number of trials were also made in the recent past in India. This technology has inherent advantages in terms of reduction of greenhouse gas emissions and economy in construction (because of less fuel consumption in construction) as well as elimination of suspected health hazards to construction workers (according to some studies the fumes from hot bituminous mixes is a health hazard). Considering the importance and need of green technology, IRC published Interim Guidelines for Warm Mix Asphalt in the year 2014. This document presents the interim guidelines for the production and construction of Warm Mix Asphalt (WMA) pavement. Subsequent to the adoption and usage of the warm mix technology in India, the feedback received on the interim guidelines from various stakeholders and also considering the advancement in materials and technology, IRC decided to revise this document. The task was assigned to Flexible Pavement, Airfield & Runways (H-2) Committee of IRC during the tenure 2018-20. The initial document was prepared by Dr. Sunil Bose, Dr. Ambika Behl and Dr. Sridhar Raju. The draft was deliberated in various meetings of H-2 Committee and was finalized in its meeting held on 8th June, 2019. The composition of H-2 Committee is given below: Reddy, Prof. (Dr.) K.

A range of warm mix technologies, which have the potential for use in bituminous construction like Dense Bituminous Macadam (DBM), Bituminous Concrete (BC) meeting the quality and performance requirements of IRC:111 and Recycled Asphalt Pavements (RAP). ii. The essential requirements of collaborative effort between the technology provider/ the product supplier on the one hand and the contracting agency on the other with a view to promoting the use of the warm mix technology. 2.2 Since the WMA technology uses a variety of patented products as additives, which come in different forms such as solid, liquid and powder and use different processes for administering the additives and mixing, these guidelines do not prescribe any specific product or process except in a generic manner at the level of technology. 2.3 The guidelines further recommend that the contracting authorities may accept any technology that claims to meet the requirements of these guidelines provided such a claim is (a) substantiated by laboratory and field tests, and (b) backed by a collaboration between the ####'),\n",

OvERvIEW OF WMA TECHNOLOGY 3.1 The basic principle of this technology is that by adding certain additives at the final stages of the mix production, the coating of the aggregates by the binder is greatly enhanced and can be achieved at a considerably less temperature (typically 300C less) compared to the hot mix process wherein bitumen is heated to a sufficiently high temperature to make it fluid enough to surround the aggregates and coat their surfaces. In hot mix process, it is the viscosity of bitumen alone, which is less at higher temperature, that plays the main role in coating of aggregates. In warm mix technology, this can be achieved in three different ways, viz. by increasing the volume of bitumen, by making the bitumen less viscous, by reducing the surface tension at aggregate bitumen interface etc. 3.2 Currently there are more than 30 different WMA technologies, using patented processes and products, which have capabilities of bringing reduction in mixing, laydown and compaction temperatures of bituminous mixes in one of the three different ways described above. Although the end effect of reduction of mixing, laydown and compaction temperatures is the same, different technologies work in different ways. This specification covers the Warm Mix Bituminous technologies currently adopted globally, classifying them into four main categories. Water based Technologies i. Foaming In essence, the “water technologies” use fine water droplets to expand the volume of binder in the mix by causing it to foam. This has the effect of increasing the volume of the bitumen, enabling it to coat aggregate at lower temperatures. The foaming technology can be further sub-divided into two classes, foaming additives and water injection system. The foaming process works by creating foamed asphalt that improves coating and compaction at lower temperature. Water expands 1,600 times when converted into steam at atmospheric pressure, and the steam is encapsulated by viscous bitumen producing foam, which occupies a much greater volume compared to the original bitumen. The water for creating the foam is either added as water through a water injection stem in a specialized equipment, or from zeolites (which contain about 20% water). Water is added at a rate of 1.25 to 2.0% by weight of bitumen (about 500 ml of water per ton of mix), whereas the zeolites are added a rate of 0.1 to 0.3% by weight of the mix. Foaming by water allows 18ºC to 30ºC reduction in temperature whereas foaming by zeolites allows a reduction of 30ºC to 40ºC. ii. Water Carrying Chemical Additives Natural and synthetic zeolites are mineral additives used to introduce water into the mix thereby creating “in-situ” foaming within the bitumen. ####'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'IRC:SP:101-2019', 'page': 4}, page_content='Zeolites in general are added to the mix with the filler during mixing process. As the mixing temperature increases the zeolites slowly release their absorbed water into the bitumen, which is dispersed throughout the mixture in the form of very fine foam droplets. This causes an increase in the volume of the bitumen and leading to improvement in its ability to coat the aggregate. iii. Wet Fine Aggregate Addition Systems In this process the bituminous binder is added to the heated coarse aggregate in the mixer. Once the coarse aggregate are well coated, fine aggregate at ambient temperature with moisture content of around 3% is introduced. The moisture vaporizes, causing the binder coating the coarse aggregate to foam, which in turn encapsulates the fine aggregate. Chemical Additives WMA technologies utilize chemical additives that have little effect on rheological properties of the binder. These products may be supplied in pellet, powder or liquid form, and then mixed into the binder or directly added to the mix. Chemical additives are Surfactants (surface active agents) that reduce surface tension between the polar aggregates and non-polar bitumen, improve wetting and reduce internal friction, and allows a reduction of 280C-500C in mixing and compaction temperatures. Typically they are added at the rate of 0.20 to 0.75 percent by weight of bitumen. Rheological Modifiers The wax based products can be described as viscosity modifying organic additives that reduce binder viscosity at high temperatures and thus allow lower mixing and paving temperatures. The additives, which are either waxes or other hydrocarbon modifiers improve lubrication by reducing the viscosity of bitumen and allow a reduction of 28ºC to 40ºC in mixing and compaction temperatures. Typical dosage amounts are 2 to 4% by weight of bitumen. Sometimes these additives are also added as modifiers for increasing the stiffness of asphalt mixes, for specialty applications, such as in racing tracks. Hybrid Technologies Hybrid technologies utilize a combination of two or more WMA technologies to achieve the reduction in temperature. For example, Low Energy Asphalt (LEA) utilizes a chemical additive with a water injection system to improve coating at lower temperatures. The additives come in different forms, such as liquid, powder, pellet and are administered in the mix production process at different stage. Accordingly, some modification in the bituminous mixing plants is necessary to administer the controlled dosage of the additives. Some additives in liquid form can be pre-blended with bitumen and would need no modification in the conventional mixing plant provided the blended bitumen contains the right dose of additive. Other additives, which are administered in the mix at certain stage during the mix production process, would require some modification in the conventional mixing plants. These modifications would generally ####'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'IRC:SP:101-2019', 'page': 5}, page_content='require a separate material (additive) feed system and a material metering system (to ensure the right dosage) which should be integrated with computerized plant control system of the mixing plant. The water-based WMA technologies would additionally need a water injection system as well. 3.3 Apart from such plant modification as required to administer the additives (described above), some modifications are needed for recalibrating the fuel burner, aggregate drying system, bitumen heating system and to take care of the possible consequences of lower temperature operation, such as contamination of the mix by un-burnt fuel and trapped moisture, condensation of bag house fines, etc to operate the plant at reduced temperature compared to that adopted for the conventional hot mix production. 4. bENEFITS OF WARM MIX ASPHALT (1) Environmental Benefits: The single most important justification for use of this technology is that it reduces the emission of green house gases by around 25 to 30% and controls thereby global warming. This would earn tradable carbon credit. Secondly, the technology is quite compatible with Reclaimed Asphalt Pavement technology, which reduces the requirement of fresh aggregates and reduces the environmental hazard associated with dumping of damaged pavement materials. (2) Health Benefits: The fumes from Hot Mix Asphalt are known to be potential health hazards, especially for the construction workers. Reduced temperature of the mix avoids this health hazard. (3) Technical advantages: a. Lower mixing temperature reduces the oxidation and ageing of bitumen and thereby gives long lasting pavement by delaying fatigue cracking. b. Much improved workability of the mix at lower temperatures gives better compactability and larger compaction window. c. Reduced rate of cooling of the mix (due to low initial temperature of the mix) permits longer haul distance from the plant to work sites and better cold weather construction opportunities. (4) Cost benefits: WMA is most likely to have long term cost advantages, though its estimation should be case specific. The cost advantage is a trade-off between the additional cost of using the additives and technologies (including plant modification) and cost savings achieved through reduced fuel consumption, longer life of pavement and use of recycled material. 5. CHOICE OF AN APPROPRIATE WMA TECHNOLOGY In the Section dealing with ‘overview’, the principles behind various alternative technologies and different additives have been presented. They provide the general guideline for an appropriate choice of technology. Secondly, since the plants and equipment used for producing WMA mixes would remain essentially the same (at least till such time the technology proliferates and its ####'),\n",

Thirdly, the suppliers of the products to be used in works should be willing to take responsibility along with the main contractor not only for their products but for the entire technological solution. All technologies and all commercial additives should be allowed to compete for acceptance on a work if the following conditions are satisfied: • Technology and/or product suppliers provide evidence of : (a) achieving the reduction of at least 300C in mixing and laying temperatures demonstrated based on some actual work done in the past. The evidence should be in the form of a certificate from the owner/owner’s representative of the said work, (b) additives proposed to be used not having any harmful effects on human health and environment. This evidence should be in the form of test certificates from reputed laboratory, (c) complete understanding of the technological solution such as dosage of additives, the process of administering the additives in a controlled manner (weight, volume, pressure, temperature, etc.), adequacy of the plant and equipment proposed to be used on the work and if not, the modifications required, quality assurance in the process, etc. This evidence should be in the form of a written quality statement. • The main contractor provides evidence of understanding of the technological requirement, including modifications in the plant and equipment and acceptance of these requirements. This evidence should be in the form of a written joint commitment statement. The selection of the best WMA technology depends on many factors, and in most cases is dependent on the monetary incentives and benefits of using WMA. Important factors to consider include the reduction in temperature that is desired, the tonnage of mix that is anticipated and whether or not to invest in plant technology that are needed for certain additives. It should also be pointed out that the “green” benefits of adopting WMA technologies should not be overlooked, and that a reduction in emission through a reduction of temperature can help contractors/ agencies receive significant amount of “carbon credits.” 6. DESIGN OF WMA MIXES The quality and performance of the WMA mix shall be the same as specified for HMA in IRC:111 except for mixing and laying temperatures, which should be at least 300C less than those specified for HMA. The threshold of 300C is considered technologically feasible as well as desirable from the point of view of fuel savings of some significance. Design of mix, quality of inputs (except the additives) and tests required to be performed shall follow the same procedures as specified in IRC:111. In addition, the following WMA specific tests shall also be performed: ####'),\n",

Since not all WMA additives effect the viscosity of bitumen and mainly work on the bitumen-aggregate interface and improve the workability of the asphalt mix at lower temperatures. Volumetric properties should be used as the criteria for optimizing the mixing and compaction temperatures for warm mixes. The above parameters should be verified first in the laboratory and after the criteria are satisfied a field trial section of at least 500 m length shall be constructed, and the parameters obtained in the laboratory may be verified. 6.1 Aggregate Coating • WMA samples shall be prepared as per AASHTO T195 (Refer Annex 1) at a temperature of at least 30°C lower than conventional hot-mix. • The warm-mix shall be evaluated for coating as per AASHTO T195. • Minimum 95% of the coarse aggregate particles shall be fully coated at a temperature of at least 30°C lower than conventional hot-mix. 6.2 Compactability Since the mixing and compaction temperatures of the warm-mix samples are lowered by at least 30°C compared to the conventional hot-mix, it is important for the warm-mix samples to attain specified mix densities at adopted lower temperatures. In order to verify that the warm-mix samples attain sufficient density when prepared at temperatures which are at least 30oC lower than those of conventional hot-mix: • Three hot-mix specimens shall be prepared conforming to the JMF as per AASHTO T245 (also adopted in MORTH Section 500 Table 10). (Refer Annex 1) • Similarly, three more warm-mix specimens shall be prepared conforming to the JMF. In all cases the JMF shall be made in the same procedure as per conventional mixes except at a temperature at least 30°C lower than the hot-mix samples as per AASHTO T245.

It is recommended that the warm-mix additives or processes should also function as anti-stripping agents, and should be able to improve the resistance of the mix to moisture susceptibility even when produced at temperatures at least 30°C lower than conventional mixes. If the warm-mix additives cannot perform as an anti-stripping agent, it must be mandated to add either hydrated lime or a liquid anti-stripping agent to the mix to improve resistance to moisture damage. However in case of WMA using foaming technology use of anti-stripping agent or lime may be detrimental. The following procedure may be adopted for evaluating the moisture damage resistance of Warm- mix asphalt mixes: • Six samples of the compacted HMA mix conforming to the JMF as per AASHTO T245 (Refer Annex 1) shall be prepared in the first instance. • The specimens shall have 7.0±0.5% air voids. • Six samples of warm-mix specimens conforming to the JMF shall be prepared at a temperature at least 30°C lower than the hot-mix samples as per AASHTO T245. The compactive effort shall be either similar for both mixes or adjusted in such a way that both the mixes have similar air voids (7.0±0.5%). • The Tensile Strength Ratio (TSR) of the hot-mix and the warm-mix shall be determined as per AASHTO T283. The TSR value of HMA shall meet the requirement of minimum 80% as specified in IRC:111. A TSR of above 80% for the warm-mix that is prepared at least 30°C below corresponding hot-mix will ensure sufficient resistance against moisture susceptibility. 7. PRODUCTION OF WARM MIX ASPHALT 7.1 Mixing Plant Requirements WMA requires mix temperatures to be significantly reduced. The two basic types of bituminous mixing plant most commonly used are the batch type mixing plant and the continuous drum type plant, both of which types can be adapted to manufacture WMA. For production of warm mixes that also contain reclaimed bituminous mixes, mixing plant design should include adequate features. When any of the various types of mixing plants are used, ####'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'IRC:SP:101-2019', 'page': 9}, page_content='it should be ensured that the Recycled Asphalt (RA) and the virgin aggregates are properly blended together; the blending process shall facilitate proper heat transfer and shall prevent both physical and thermal segregation. As with any new technology, there are a few concerns about the production of WMA, specifically because of the lower temperatures that are utilized during production. Fortunately, all of these problems are expected and solvable in many cases through the adoption of techniques that could also be utilized for improving conventional HMA production. The first concern is about incomplete drying of aggregates (specifically the internal moisture) at the reduced temperatures. It has been seen that for aggregates with an absorption value of less than 1%, drying of aggregate has not been reported to be a problem at WMA temperatures. To prevent the incomplete drying of aggregates, it is suggested that stockpiles be kept as dry as possible by sloping sides, paving surrounding areas, and keeping them under cover. To dry aggregates with high moisture content the retention time in the dryer drum could be increased and the dryer shell should be insulated properly. Ways to detect incomplete drying include a greater than 20ºC fall in temperature in mix between discharge and loading, dripping water from silos and excessive steam from slat conveyors and a loss of more than 0.5% of the weight of mix during moisture content test. The second concern is regarding incomplete combustion of fuel at the reduced temperature and the resulting risk of getting unburnt fuel in the mix. Evidence of such a problem includes brownish color of mix and higher than normal emissions. Proper maintenance and tuning of burner and preheating of burner fuel are recommended solutions to this problem. The last but not least problem is the potential of condensation of baghouse fines, leading to the clogging and decreased efficiency of the emission control system. Recommended solutions include proper preheating of baghouse, sealing of leaks, adjusting flights and slopes of the dryer to increase baghouse exhaust temperature, insulation of baghouse and ductwork and addition of duct heaters to increase baghouse temperatures, if needed. A high- pressure drop within a range greater than 0.28 to 0.35 kg/cm2 across the bags is an indicator of caking due to condensation. 7.2 WMA Technology Addition Systems For WMA Technologies, both rheological modifier and chemical additive types that are blended into the binder shall be added through the mixing plant’s normal binder addition system. These may also be blended at terminals and supplied to project sites through conventional transportation system. Water carrying chemical additives, which are in powdered form, can be added manually into the pugmill of batch type mixers either through the filler system, or by intruding it through the RA collar. Equipment to produce foamed bitumen may be installed on both batch and continuous drum mixing plant types. The systems obviously operate differently, with separate generations of foamed bitumen for each batch in the former type of plant and a continuous production of foam in the latter plant type’s case. ####'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'IRC:SP:101-2019', 'page': 10}, page_content='Conventional types of bituminous mix plants shall have the following monitoring and control systems: - Binder storage tank heating temperature - Integrated individual cold feed hopper (new aggregate and RA) and burner fuel flow - Burner fuel flow meter - Infrared temperature monitor - Infrared silo discharge temperature monitor Foaming systems should include integrated flow metering and pressure sensing systems for both the binder and the water used to produce the foam. 7.3 RAP and WMA WMA (Warm Mix Asphalt) and RAP (Recycled Asphalt Pavement) present their own individual benefits and costs. WMA has the ability to reduce production costs and environmental impacts by reducing fuel consumption and emissions production by reducing the asphalt mix production and compaction temperatures. Furthermore, certain types of WMA additives or processes have the ability to improve permanent deformation resistance, fracture resistance, and moisture sensitivity. The use of RAP can also reduce costs and ecological production effects by utilizing a recycled material. However, the increased stiffness of RAP asphalt binder as compared to HMA and WMA asphalt binder could be problematic if it is used excessively. Combining WMA and RAP can offer potential improvements in pavement performance compared to using either material alone. AASHTO M320 recommends the use of a softer virgin binder grade for higher (greater than 25%) RAP contents. Adding warm-mix is the perfect solution, as lower mixing temperatures result in less binder aging during production and consequently, a softer binder. A RAP mix produced at warm-mix temperatures should then have ample stiffness to resist rutting, as well as sufficient viscoelastic behavior to resist cracking. Plant operations are also improved when WMA and RAP are used together. As per IRC:120, for hot in plant recycling a maximum of 30% RAP content is recommended to be used, whereas with the use of warm mix additives this 30% rap content can be increased to 40-50%. The limit in the use of Reclaimed Asphalt Pavement material (RAP) proportion is restricted due to stiffness and workability issues related to RAP. This problem is addressed with the help of Warm Mix Asphalt (WMA) which increases the proportion of RAP used by producing mixes having same/better properties viz., better workability, reduced viscosity than Hot Mix Asphalt (HMA) at lower temperatures. For this purpose the RAP mix shall be designed as per IRC:120, the RAP proportion may be increased up to 40% with the addition of warm mix additives. 8.

Further, when the WMA mixes include reclaimed bituminous mixes, additional testing shall be required. The properties of the binder contained in the RA (Recycled Asphalt) have to be taken into account at mix design stage and the consistency of the recovered binder properties shall be checked regularly. Typically the moisture content, grading and binder content of each RA fraction shall be checked prior to the start of the day’s mix production. A proposed job mix formula for a WMA must be evaluated for its fatigue cracking resistance (with the mix incorporating WMA additive, specifically for wax based additive) prior to being approved for construction. Warm mix additives can be used with all types of mixes (BC, DBM and SMA etc.) and with all types of binders i.e. PMB, rubber modified and viscosity grade binders. It is advised to perform lab trial for asphalt mix design to check the volumetric properties before field application. 10.

Jean Lefebvre, a French construction company as a cost-effective maintenance alternative to concrete roads developed this technology. In India, the CGBM technology was initially developed by a premier laboratory and a few stretches were constructed with this technology. CGBM technology consists of having a high void bituminous mix in which highly flow able high strength grout is poured which occupies all voids and make it water tight. This also leads to substantial improvement in the engineering properties. Performance study on CGBM overlay was carried out by CRRI and noted that compared to conventional bituminous mixes there is substantial improvement in engineering properties of this material. This technology has been adopted by Surat Municipal Corporation and in several other city roads. National laboratory at Chennai was requested to develop the grout and conduct laboratory tests on CGBM samples to ensure that engineering properties recommended for grout and CGBM based on various references are achievable. The task of preparation of these Guidelines was taken up by H-9 Committee during the tenure 2012-14. The initial guidelines prepared by Dr. Animesh Das, Professor, IIT Kanpur in the year 2012 and discussed in the then H-9 Committee. Based on various references and research work at IIT Kharagpur & CSIR-CRRI, New Delhi, the initial guidelines were modified by late Prof. B.B. Pandey, IIT Kharagpur.

Bituminous wearing course of such pavements often suffer wet weather damage which gets aggravated in cities due to flooding during monsoon. The pavements at traffic intersections, parking places and bus stops are noticeably damaged due to frequent braking action and fuel spillage. So, there arises a need for durable wearing course which is (i) strong enough to resist braking and accelerating effect of traffic (ii) fuel resistant (iii) impervious to water ####'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'IRC:SP:125-2019', 'page': 3}, page_content=\"and (iv) moisture resistant. Research at IIT Kharagpur and at CSIR-CRRI has shown that open graded bituminous layer grouted with a cementitious grout can form a durable wearing course. Some other research Institute had developed similar product which has been used at a few locations in Kharagpur, Surat and Amravati. Flexible and Rigid pavements are common in India and now composite pavements are emerging. The present guidelines deal with the design, preparation and application procedure for CGBM to be laid over bituminous surface. Almost single graded bituminous mix (having voids more than 25% which is more than the voids in traditional dense graded bituminous mixes) is paved and grouted with cement grout as under: i) Mixed with optimum dose of bituminous binder (sometimes fibers may be added to prevent drain down) (ii) paved over a base (iii) compacted to design density (iv) filled with cementitious grout slurry (sufficiently flowable cement grout is applied on the compacted surface). This cement grout is primarily prepared by mixing suitable proportions of cement, fine sand and water. Other materials like fly ash, micro silica, super plasticizers, fibres etc. may be adequately and suitably added in order to improve the grout flowability and strength of grout. CGBM is to be generally used as surface layer, but it also has potential to be used as base course. International Applications of CGBM The pavement surface made with this kind of technology seemed to have been developed in France during 1960s and was known as 'resin modified pavement'. In USA it was first applied during 1987 (1). Various countries where CGBM has been used include France, USA, Germany, Japan, Spain, Portugal, Sweden, Norway, Finland, Saudi Arabia, Great Britain, China, Denmark, Malaysia, South Africa and Austria etc. CGBM technology had been reportedly used in bus stations, parking areas, warehouses, roads, aprons, etc. For Road Surface Treatments (RSTA), UK has developed a code of practice for grouted Macadam, approved by ADEPT (Association of Directors of Environment, Economy, Planning and Transport, UK) (2) and the same has also been approved by the Highway Authorities Product Approval Scheme (HAPAS), UK in 2006. CGBM was implemented by an organization called CIP Jointless Surfacing, England, primarily in Harbours, Airports, Warehouse Distributions, Bus- Depot Stations, Manufacturing-Production areas etc. However, in UK, there is no BSEN (British Standards, Europe) specification on CGBM as yet. In other parts of Europe like Denmark, Netherlands, Sweden etc. this technology has been extensively used. The Copenhagen Airport, Denmark already laid approximately 3 lac m2 of CGBM. M/S BREMAT, Rosmalen, Netherlands carried out the execution and maintenance of this technology in Roundabouts, Intersections and Signals. Stockholm, Sweden implemented CGBM at different Bus stops and Bus-Depot stations, to bear the static loads and to diminish the chances of wearing and tearing. In USA, primarily CGBM has been incorporated in Army bases, Air force Stations and Airports. McCord Air force Base, Washington and Logan International Airport, MA, has constructed CGBM pavement for having durable surface. To develop a fuel damage resistant surface Malmstrom Air Force base, Montana, has constructed wearing surface incorporating CGBM. Mississippi Department of Transportation performed a project investigating grouted macadam at two signalized, heavily trafficked intersections. ####\"),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'IRC:SP:125-2019', 'page': 4}, page_content='In the Asia Pacific, CGBM has been widely implemented in Malaysia, China, Australia, Japan, Saudi Arabia etc. Kualalampur City Council has implemented CGBM technology extensively in heavily trafficked surface, Bus Lanes in the city area and maintenance of this is taken care of by Kualampur City Hall, since 2001. In China, Ministry of Construction of Chinese Technologies had executed several projects in late 20th Century. Considering the widespread application of CGBM around the world, it may prove to be an emerging sustainable technology in road infrastructure development. The advantages of using CGBM surface in comparison to conventional pavement are as follows: \\uf0fc Resistance to oil induced damages caused due to fuel spillage \\uf0fc Resistance to permanent deformation \\uf0fc Resistance to abrasion/wearing \\uf0fc Resistance against moisture induced damages \\uf0fc Lower thermal susceptibility in comparison to flexible pavements \\uf0fc Impermeability and good skid resistance property These advantages enable CGBM surface to take care of some of the individual limitations linked to cement concrete and bituminous mixes. Past researchers have conducted laboratory studies on stiffness, tensile and compressive strength, Marshall Stability, thermal expansion coefficient, low temperature fracture, fatigue properties of CGBM and found to show satisfactory performance. Recently, CSIR-CRRI has conducted detailed laboratory testing and evaluation of Trial section of CGBM in two roads of Municipal Corporation in Surat, Gujarat. The laboratory study included testing for compressive strength, stability, indirect tensile strength, moisture sensitivity, oil induced damage, wheel tracking test, resilient modulus, modulus of rupture, dynamic creep, flow number, dynamic modulus, etc. The study conducted by CRRI on CGBM trial section included visual inspection for any surface distress, core analysis for verification of full depth grouting, volumetric analysis using micro-CT technique, surface friction measurement and FWD survey. Trial stretches were studied on rural roads in heavy rainfall areas of West Bengal, a bridge deck and Dadar flyover in Mumbai City, roads of Municipal Corporations of Mumbai and Surat, etc. have given good performance. In hot summer, the cement grouted wearing course did not display any bleeding or rutting. 2 SCOPE These guidelines discuss construction of laying of surface layer for Cement Grouted Bituminous Mix (CGBM), preferably over an existing bituminous pavement. CGBM is based on the concept of preparing a coarse aggregate skeleton structure which is then filled with cementitious grout material. A few trial stretches are also in progress where it is proposed to change the conventional seal coat on bituminous premix carpet with cement grouted seal coat. Minor changes in gradation are made to create more voids. This new type of wearing course is suitable for traffic up to 30 msa, in case of a new flexible pavement or as an overlay/renewal coat over an existing flexible pavement; though it can be used for heavier traffic as well if the base is strong. Such pavements have the benefit of flexibility of the bituminous pavement while possessing advantage of rigid pavement as well. Typically, the open graded aggregates are coated with about 3.25% to 4.0% bitumen. However, CRRI study on CGBM with a specified gradation finds that lower limit of ####'),\n",

Once the paved high voids bituminous surface cools down to ambient temperature, the cementitious grout is poured over the surface which penetrates and fills up the voids and forms an impervious layer.

Properties of grout, method of construction of cement grouted bituminous layer as well as pavement design principles are included in the guidelines. Users of the guidelines should maintain a record of pavement performance periodically and send their feedback to Indian Roads Congress for the future revision of the guidelines. 3 MATERIALS 3.1 Coarse Aggregate The coarse aggregate shall consist of crushed rock retained on 2.36 mm sieve.

Though aggregate bears most of the traffic load, the grout should be strong enough to resist the stresses caused by traffic without crushing. Proportion of sand and fly ash may be varied to optimize strength and flowability of grout. Fly ash and silica fume, also known as micro silica are used to improve strength, durability and the performance. Super plasticizer/ chemical additive is used to get the required fluidity at the lower water contents for cement grout without loss of strength. Polymer additive in the powder form or liquid form imparts early strength to the mortar. For design of cement grout, various proportion of cement, fine sand passing 600 µm sieve, silica fumes, fly ash and ultra-water reducer are to be worked out to obtain desired properties. Extensive study at IIT Kharagpur indicated that the proportions of cement: sand: micro silica: fly ash of 40:40:10:10 and a super plasticizer of 0.5% by weight of the dry powder; all by weight and a water/binder ratio of 0.55 gave satisfactory results. Similarly, laboratory experiments done by other premier laboratory, with proportion of cement: sand: micro silica: fly ash of 38:10:10:42 with super-plasticizer of 0.3% and w/c of 0.25 have given satisfactory results to meet all desired properties as mentioned in Appendix. Possibly some other combinations may also be able to achieve the performance parameters as stated in Appendix. Since material properties may differ due to different sources, several mix design trials with different proportions are necessary. The grout should satisfy the following criteria: \\uf0fc It should be sufficiently flow-able so that it can occupy the voids of the high voids bituminous mix. \\uf0fc Sand present in the grout should not pose difficulty for easy flow of grout through the voids in the mix. Any commercially available ready mixed dry powders (grout) can also be used if they meet the performance parameters, as stated in Appendix. The flowability of cement grout is to be measured using Flow Cone as per ASTM C939. The performance properties expected from grout and CGBM composite are given in Table 3. 4 BITUMINOUS MIX DESIGN FOR CGBM 4.1 Aggregate Gradation The combined grading of the coarse and fine aggregates for CGBM is shown in Table 2. This Table consists of three gradations namely Gradation I, II & III for preparing bituminous mixes with voids suitable for CGBM, out of which Gradation I & II are as per Table 500-21 of MoRT&H Specifications for Surface Dressing and Gradation III is similar to Open Graded Friction Course as per ASTM. Gradation III has slightly lower air voids as compared to Gradation I and II. Generally, open gradations are preferred for CGBM so that minimum air void content of 25% is available in the bituminous mix skeleton. Selection of any gradation for CGBM can be made with the objective that cementitious grout flows freely into the voids of bituminous mix.

The formula used for the calculation of air voids in dry aggregates is given below in Equation 1. % Voids = 100 [(5 × W) – M]/(5 × W) ……… (1) Where, M = bulk density of the aggregate, kg/m3 S = bulk specific gravity (dry basis) W = density of water, 998 kg/m3 4.3 Selection of Optimum Binder Content by Draindown Test Draindown of the loose bituminous mix shall be determined according to ASTM D 6390 (see Annexure B for outline of the test). The drainage test should be performed at the anticipated plant production temperature and should satisfy the specified maximum drain down of 0.30%. If the mixture fails to meet this requirement, then fibers can be added to a level that reduces drain down to the acceptable limit. There is a scope for reduction in bitumen dose which improves resistance against water penetration and may increase the ratio of ITS wet/ITS dry, However, as this may make the mix more brittle, reduction of bitumen dose below 3.25% is not recommended. Adequate quantity of bitumen is needed to maintain the nature of the prepared CGBM as flexible layer. 4.4 Determining Compaction Effort The samples of high voids bituminous mix for CGBM can be prepared in different ways; namely (i) Marshal samples of 100 mm dia., (ii) Extracting cores from compacted slabs and (iii) extracting 100 mm dia. core from 150 mm dia.

Compaction effort needs to be worked out by analyzing the lowering rate of air voids in the sample being prepared with respect to increase in the number of blows (compaction effort). Out of three gradations given in Table 2, only 40 blows are suggested for Gradation I & II and 60 blows for Gradation III, all applied on one face of the Marshall sample only. 4.5 Sample Preparation and Testing Four samples for each of the trial gradations at the bitumen content selected as per draindown test are to be prepared.

The recommended and acceptable values would depend on method of preparation of sample. Appendix also describes the method for sample preparation which is suggested as per the equipment available at project site laboratory. The various engineering properties of grout and composite CGBM recommended in Table 3 are based on the methods of sample preparation and test procedure as described in Appendix. 7.2 During Pavement Construction For field application of CGBM surface layer, different stages of work need to be accomplished. The existing bituminous surface is first cleaned and then emulsion (RS1) or low viscosity paving bitumen of VG 10 grade is spread over it as tack coat as per MoRT&H Specifications. A layer of open graded high void bituminous mix is then laid using the paver. Depending upon the grade of bitumen used, the mixed material shall be in the range of 140-1700C. The laying temperature shall be in the range of 130-1500C. The bituminous mix is then compacted with smooth wheeled roller, once its temperature is in the range of 80-1000C. The paved bituminous mix is then compacted with 10 tons static steel wheel roller for 4 to 6 passes to obtain the desired density and the target air voids. Once the compacted bituminous surface cools down to ambient temperature, the requisite quantity of cementitious grout material mixed thoroughly with water can then be poured and spread uniformly over the entire porous surface. Cement grout preferably can be prepared in Pan Mixer so that all ingredients gets fully inter mixed. If patented intimately mixed dry powder is available, then use of Pan Mixer can be avoided and any simple blending equipment to produce liquid grout can be used. Grout can also be produced in the mixer of RMC plant. Grout would automatically flow into voids under the effect of gravity and its flowability. Sweeping or simple such techniques can be adopted to accelerate the process of grout penetration. Any excess grout observed on the surface shall be removed and any unfilled air voids observed are to be again filled with grout. The grout spread over the high voids bituminous mix surface is allowed to set for one day and then the section is cured by sprinkling of water for 7 days. The grouting operation should not be done in rainy or snowy environment. The field procedure to be adopted and the corresponding stages for laying the CGBM surface are outlined in Annexure E. 8 RESILIENT MODULUS, FATIGUE LIFE AND STRENGTH OF CGBM In a typical case the Resilient Modulus (E) measured from Indirect Tensile test (ASTM D4123) for the cement grouted bituminous mix were found to vary from 12000 MPa to 15000 MPa in the laboratory at temperature 350C. However, a reduced modulus of 5000 MPa may be considered for pavement design considering (i) variability in grading of aggregates (ii) partial penetration of grout in the field and (iii) cracks caused by the construction traffic. The modulus of rupture (M , R for Flexural strength) was found to be 2.5 MPa. A value of 1.25 MPa may be considered as the M value of the grouted macadam for the purpose of checking adequacy of pavement crust. R Poisons ratio (µ) may be taken as 0.25.

Therefore, CGBM can be concluded as Visco-elastic material. 9 PAVEMENT DESIGN Elastic layered analysis applied for the analysis of flexible pavements can be used for the design of composite pavement as well. Parameters to be considered for design are CBR of the soil, elastic modulus of the granular layers, elastic modulus of the grouted bituminous layers, Poison’s ratio of different layers and design traffic in terms of standard axles. At present, the structural design (layer thickness) of pavements having CGBM layer can be worked out using the Fatigue Equation as given by IIT Kharagpur and mentioned above in Para 8. Modulus of different types of bases, sub bases and sub grades can be taken from IRC:37-2018. Based on studies done at Nottingham University, CSIR-CRRI, New Delhi and IIT Kharagpur, the resilient modulus of CGBM can be taken as 5000 MPa (based on laboratory evaluated values ranging from 8000 to 15000 MPa at test temperature of 35°C). ####'),\n",

The morphology of the voids produced should be such that it allows easy flow of the grout through them and then their subsequent filling with the flowing grout itself. The design objective of high voids bituminous mix differs from that of conventional dense graded bituminous mixes. The main design criterion for high void bituminous mixes being: (a) optimum binder content while limiting the drain down and (b) compaction effort needed to achieve optimal density and requisite volume of interconnected air voids. The results shown in this Appendix for Gradings I, II & III of CGBM have been obtained from test conducted at CSIR-CRRI, IIT Kharagpur and another premier laboratory. Detailed methodology, test procedure, sample preparation, test results of laboratory prepared samples and field core samples are given in this Appendix. The compiled test results for the three considered gradations of CGBM are given in Table A1 to A3. 1. Aggregate Gradation and its Effect on Packing Characteristics Air voids content in compacted bituminous mix will depend to a greater extent on the gradation of aggregate, binder content, type of binder and compaction method and energy used to compact the same. The packaging characteristics of different gradations can be defined by imparting similar compaction efforts and determining the voids. Different methods for determining air voids in an aggregate gradation are discussed below. These can be used to check the relative suitability of different gradations for preparation of high voids bituminous mixes. a. Using IS 2386 Part 3 The aggregates selected for the specific gradation should be mixed thoroughly and then, filled into a cylindrical vessel of 250 mm diameter and 15 liters capacity, in three layers. Each layer should be subjected to 25 strokes of round edged tamping rod of 16 mm diameter. Dry Aggregate Air Voids (DAAV) can then be determined by the following equation: G \\uf02d\\uf067 AirvoidsinDryAggregate\\uf03d s \\uf0b4100 G s where Air voids in Dry Aggregate is in percentage G = specific gravity of the aggregate, s g = bulk density in kg/litre b.
